<h1 align="center">4 THE VIDEOGAME, AS PASSAGE TO NON-STANDARD THOUGHT</h1>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="262" class="position" href="m.html#262" title="Anthropology and videogames perform images.">262</a></div>
	
<div>I have said that this project is as much about anthropology as it is about videogames, but what something is about is less important than what it performs. Every anthropology PhD thesis, monograph, article or whatever, performs an anthropological image, while merely representing some other phenomenon. <em>And the former, as immanent performation, is the site of the real.</em> In this website, I have taken every opportunity available, not only to represent the performation of the videogame image in new ways but to offer the reader (player) an image-event which, like videogames, makes obvious its immanent identity as an incomplete, unresolved inter-human event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="263" class="position" href="m.html#263" title="Videogames offer a new style of thought.">263</a></div> 

<div>But this would all be for nothing if the argument allowed, here in this final segue, our exit from this image-event; to fold back on itself and assume an actual penetration of its real cause, namely the videogame. This circular manoeuvre, as Laruelle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1985" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1985/2018) A biography of ordinary man">1985/2018</a>)</span> has argued, is philosophy’s hallucination and hubris. Assuming such a circle would also prevent us from maintaining the identity of the videogame we have been establishing throughout, namely its status as a becoming rather than a static thing or representation. The extent and limits of <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> are to point to the videogame as a tool for leveraging a new style of thought, a new orientation in relation to images and our production of them, which is less violent, less fascistic and less dehumanising. In Laruelle’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span> terms, this is to declare the foreclosure of the real in relation to the videogame, as human event, and to refuse philosophical decision (maybe Laruelle is the final boss here).</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="264" class="position" href="m.html#264" title="Boundaries dissolve to embracing new image-events.">264</a></div> 

<div>Image production, consumption and the thing that an image is of constitute the fictional boundaries set out as a means of structuring the previous pages’ explorations of the videogame image. For the sake of <em>this</em> image, we must now undo these distinctions once more before stopping, recognizing them as artificial features of the videogame image. In the end, things will be simple, and this website will be framed as something we do. We will call this action a new image, the static image which captures, encompasses and encloses, being dead — not because we defeated it but because it was and is always dead.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="265" class="position" href="m.html#265" title="The real is seen in Street Fighter’s image.">265</a></div>

<div>The dialogic image of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match has been explored in relation to and in opposition to Deleuze’s movement-image. In this framing, we can identify the real at the site of image production. The real was called, in this instance, a dialogic human event. <em>Street Fighter</em> entails, at the level of its complex game mechanics and techniques, a potential mode which aligns with scientific thought, as was noted (<a title="The ‘science’ of Street Fighter has a limit, unlike natural science." target="_blank" href="2.html#085">085</a>). This includes frame data, which reduces cause into a quantifiable and deterministic aspect that is employed in a player’s favour (<a title="Combo strings pull virtual lines into a win state." target="_blank" href="2.html#086">086</a>). But this inherent reduction, so fundamental to the event, does not encompass the event itself when the time comes to actually play the game. The presence of this knowledge can influence the outcome. Like science, it is employed but its implementation does not constitute thought itself. We know this because of the difference between watching a replay and playing the game. Playing poses a question into our situation that we have got to do something with (<a title="‘Becoming aware’: ‘this man is not my object...’." target="_blank" href="2.html#094">094</a>). Therefore, while there is a dialogue transpiring in the videogame event, it cannot be located or described beyond the level of full participation. We are already there, in/of this real dialogue, which is not the external experience of a representation or reduction, but we are there because we are playing the game and are of the same source as that dialogue and this source is foreclosed. Mechanics makes cause obvious, but the cause of the real, the cause of ourselves, the ultimate cause of this event, the cause which supersedes all frame trapping and combo strings, is determined in the last instance by the real as foreclosed.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="266" class="position" href="m.html#266" title="Real-time gameplay is unidirectional.">266</a></div> 

<div>We can record a match and watch it again, learn from our mistakes and notice habits that make us predictable. This is study is another practice, it involves replaying, rewinding, observing the recorded image. It is a practice that can lend itself to the image-event of a match. But we cannot rewind the match itself because it unfolds in a unidirectional way and is happening in real-time. This is how Laruelle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span> describes the real or the One: its foreclosure is tied to its being able to move, as causality, in a single direction. This applies equally to associations with the real as well, so when I say the dialogic match itself, as an event, is the site of the real, I mean it is in-One, being ‘determined in the last instance’ by the One, not that it itself is the One. The event is only separate from the One from the event’s perspective because of the unidirectionality mentioned is radical. So while the performation of watching a replay is in-One as much as a match is, the former is accompanied by a hallucination, inherent in the act of capture and retrieval, which forms a circle where the foreclosure of the real and the unidirectionality of its causality are not recognised. But the recognition of this foreclosure is inherent in the act of gameplay itself, even while it is not formally articulated, it must be respected. It is ridiculous to say, but one cannot practice philosophy or anthropology while playing a <em>Street Fighter</em> match, if one hopes to win. Laruelle’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span> force-(of)-thought or stranger-subject, is simply manifested.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="267" class="position" href="m.html#267" title="The videogame image as ‘analytically simple’.">267</a></div> 

<div>The first half of <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">page 2</a> framed the videogame event as ‘analytically simple’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dilworth <a href="5.html#Dilworth 2013" target="_blank" title="Dilworth C (2013) Simplicity: a meta-metaphysics">2013</a>)</span> so that the irreducible element, the limit of our analysis, was identified as a smallest part that could not be further abstracted. We identified the real to make it appear within the phenomena, as a specific instance, couched in a broader context. Our procedure resembled a zooming in and searching of the micro elements of the image and associated practices for an aspect sufficient to account for those elements. In this gesture we explored the association of the cinema with the videogame, the role of cinematographic techniques, the lack of montage in <em>Street Fighter</em>, frame data, animation. However, none of these described an event that can account for those elements. We were only able to show what the videogame image looks like through captured footage and by distinguishing it from the images of other mediums to generate new conceptual images. A space was left at the centre for the irreducible; we placed the thing that could serve as their irreducible source within and amongst those elements themselves so that they were orbiting it. This threshold, where descriptions become insufficient, pertains to how we referred to the real in those sections. We localised it to an instance of dialogue, which all other parts of the image event served.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="268" class="position" href="m.html#268" title="The videogame image as ‘synthetically simple’.">268</a></div> 

<div>The second half of <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">page 2</a> framed the videogame event as ‘synthetically simple’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dilworth <a href="5.html#Dilworth 2013" target="_blank" title="Dilworth C (2013) Simplicity: a meta-metaphysics">2013</a>)</span>, so that the image-event became too vast, via the body and the conditions of experience. Rather than analysing the separate parts of the image, we pivoted to incorporate everything into the event, to acknowledge the contributions of all aspects of the situation into the image-event. This meant incorporating the conditions of experience into how we experience the image as well, via Merleau-Ponty, framing the body as transcendental and eventually giving the videogame image itself the status of transcendental. This entailed a posture that could resolve the two ‘simple’ extremes. The irreducible element becomes our performance of the image itself, determined in the last instance, as a videogame image always is.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="269" class="position" href="m.html#269" title="The necessity of the non-violent videogame image.">269</a></div> 

<div>However, this participation has serious implications, when the frequent violence of videogame images is considered. <a href="3.html" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">Page 3</a> is dedicated to addressing these implications in a way that does not undo the transcendental status of the videogame previously established. Coping with videogame violence via a non-participation, pushing the videogame away from us as a transcendent thing to be abstracted and rationalised, is the standard philosophical path. But this would have completely undermined the rest of the project. <a href="3.html" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">Page 3</a> needed to find a way to participate in the videogame image-event, as transcendental performance, in a way that can be creative and redemptive. That is, we needed to discover a posture in which the videogame becomes an active means of non-violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="270" class="position" href="m.html#270" title="The violence of the lived event of the image.">270</a></div>

<div>‘Non-violence’ is a counter-intuitive description of videogames or any imaging technology. If the medium is the container for potentially violent images, how can this process, by which all images occur, itself be non-violent? <a href="3.html" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">Page 3</a> identifies a more immanent source of violence in the image, separate from the author’s intent, or the event of capture. This violence is located in the lived event of experiencing the image, via the viewer or player’s role in the event of image production. This is an implication of the transcendental status of the videogame image, which pulls us in and makes us intimately involved and partially responsible for all the elements of an image event, including its violence. In this mode, the source of violence is not out there in the transcendent World, or History — the history of the image, e.g. its ‘original author’ — but <em>here</em> in this transcendental event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="271" class="position" href="m.html#271" title="A creative response over non-participation.">271</a></div>

<div>This participation is not the achievement of a new posture we have assumed; a new posture can acknowledge it, but participation itself is inescapable. Even the labelling or critiquing of an image on the grounds of its violence entails a participation in the reductive event (<a title="Critiques of violent images often participate in them." target="_blank" href="3.html#215">215</a>). So rather than suggesting non-participation, which only performs its own reduction, all ways of regarding images, can be made accountable to the radically immanent lived experience, to be then creatively deployed in new ways.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="272" class="position" href="m.html#272" title="The videogame is a disaster to authoritarian styles of thought.">272</a></div>

<div>This is how the videogame, as transcendental image, can be regarded as non-violent. If the videogame is regarded as a static image-object, there are many obvious <em>ways</em> to think of it as violent, but when the videogame becomes an organon for generating <em>new ways</em>, and not a <em>way</em> itself, it is no longer something to be critiqued on those grounds, <em>but a resistance to categorisation and a disaster to authoritarian styles of thought</em>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="273" class="position" href="m.html#273" title="The image’s non-philosophical redemption from itself.">273</a></div>

<div>To regard the videogame as a transcendental image means allowing the videogame to act as a transcendental organon, for a new orientation with all images. If images are philosophical, videogames are <em>non-philosophical</em>. Images contain a philosophical circle in their performance of capture and in the way they refer back to the act of perception itself. Undoubtedly, videogames can do this too but only while we regard videogames as image-objects, and not while we are intently playing them. Thus, videogames can constitute the image’s non-philosophical redemption from itself where it stops trying to circumscribe the human — and what we call ‘human’ here is the image-event as ‘ordinary man’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1985" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1985/2018) A biography of ordinary man">1985/2018</a>)</span>. This event is determined in the last instance, in a way that is anterior to all other categorisations <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1985" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1985/2018) A biography of ordinary man">1985/2018</a>)</span>. This is why <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> must resist all categorisations in its performance. Like videogames, it strives to be a disaster to the purchase that authoritarian thought can have within the confines of the event of this image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="274" class="position" href="m.html#274" title="To challenge the authoritarian image.">274</a></div>

<div>This project’s resistance to categorisation is a resistance to authoritarian thought. Previous pages perform a transcendental image of the human via videogames and anthropology. Every opportunity to discover and reveal these aspects, in the act of reading and participating in the image itself, is sought and actioned within the limits of time and my technical abilities — embedding videogames in the pages became unfeasible. Thus, we performed an interactive website containing images, videos, optional branching paths and meta-analysis or second-order abstractions of the work as an image. This behaviour was according to the real, in that its own demands, the demands of its own phenomena as something we play, were strived for over any decision to capture it. The videogame, as a subject of interest, demanded this from us because a videogame is always played ‘according to the real’ and is never ultimately <em>of</em> the real <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span>. The levelling of the anthropological image to the videogame image, both as image-events, was a disaster for authoritarian thought because it was no longer challenged, but subordinated to a mode of relative autonomy as mere image next to the videogame. These stances, positions, framings or arguments are <em>content</em> for the image-event, not via a relativism, which sees all indifferently from a position of dominance, but through a unidirectional <em>performance</em> that is invested in the occasion, yet does not turn back to dominate it. The content of the website explores these aspects of the videogame, as it is dialogic; involving constant interactions between players, developers, devices, etc.; as it is embodied; so that the experience of the videogame image is not limited to the screen alone; as it is transcendental; so that the image-event, even the lived experience of the videogame, is an <em>a priori</em> condition of thought. We followed a trajectory of successive frames or construals of the videogame so that it overtakes us as unframed image-event. Finally, to not philosophically circle back and circumscribe the real, radically immanent, lived, human experience of a videogame (but this was made applicable beyond the videogame), we described the gesture of encompassment inherent in representation as a type of violence, as reduction of the irreducible human. This was done via, and partially in response to, the popular problematic of videogame violence, to posit performation over representation, before here, on this page, discovering and associating this gesture with the works of François Laruelle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>; <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="275" class="position" href="m.html#275" title="This image is an unfinished event.">275</a></div>

<div>This is the end of the second small way, mentioned at <a title="Think of this project as three ways." target="_blank" href="1.html#009">009</a>. Each way is an image, the image on your screen. The image is a by-product of a dialogue between us. Each way is also a performance that is redeemed automatically, via its transcendental status as an unfinished event.</div>
