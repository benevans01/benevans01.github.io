<h1 align="center">Violence is a stillness (c)</h1>
<h2 align="center"><em>December 2019</em></h2>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c01" class="position" href="m.html#c01" title="Pressing the ‘Y’ button.">c01</a></div>
		
<div>Lara kneels over a puddle, rubbing mud onto her body, up her arms and over her face <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Chayer <a href="5.html#Chayer 2018" target="_blank" title="Chayer D (2018) Shadow of the tomb raider [videogame]">2018</a>)</span>. Her bow is automatically drawn, and I move forward stealthily with her low, crouching posture. She presses herself against a muddy wall covered in roots and disappears. Everything is still. A man holding a machine gun approaches from around the corner and I am prompted to press the ‘Y’ button. Lara burst out of the foliage slamming her pickaxe into the man’s chest before pulling his body out of sight. This smallest of movements, the clicking impress of the ‘Y’ button – anyone watching me would say I had not moved – has killed him.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c02" class="position" href="m.html#c02" title="The stillness of violent thought.">c02</a></div>
		
<div>The violence is given as a lack of resistance. The controller is the shape of my hand and is easy to hold, the buttons are easy to press, and the trigger is easy to pull. There is a fluidity and gracefulness to her movements, a momentum as I jump, climb, fall, roll, dodge, stab and shoot. She wants to keep going and I only must let her, continue what has already happened and do as instructed. Where is thought? There is a calmness to the inner waters of my psyche and each death is absorbed into the still ocean of my being.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c03" class="position" href="m.html#c03" title="Killing is a self affirmation.">c03</a></div>
		
<div>The first kill felt like a disturbance, but it was also a halting, a sudden resistance to change, an affirmation of internal sameness. Lara is spotted, enemies shout and fire their machine guns at me. She jumps up a ledge and, reaching the top, I see a man climbing up a ladder on the opposite side of the platform. She draws her pistol. I shoot him twice in the head and he falls backward to the ground. I run across a bridge connecting two platforms as Lara reloads. Another enemy approaches on the ground below and I put three bullets in him. In the act of killing lies a hidden word, easily missed though it is screamed, which is satisfying and self-affirming: ‘Me!’. I confirm myself in relation to the Other by killing them: ‘Still here!’. I am brooding over the waters of my selfhood and they are still. The Other has been consumed but the waters are not disturbed.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c04" class="position" href="m.html#c04" title="The self affirmed is absolute.">c04</a></div>

<div>This hidden word says ‘no’, as in, ‘not otherwise’ – ‘”I” is always a Nay become audible’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:173)</span>: ‘I am here, I will remain unchanged, and not otherwise’. This self is not dividual, it is not divisible or a constituent of something larger, nor does it enter into relation with other beings for it does not derive its selfhood from any act or event. It is, rather, an essence that consumes all, the absolute which cannot change, and, therefore, a stillness at all costs. I wake up, chained to a stone altar <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Stratton and Martin <a href="5.html#Stratton 2016" target="_blank" title="Stratton M and Martin H (directors) (2016) Doom [videogame]">2016</a>)</span>. A demon stumbles towards me from across the room. Exerting my strength, I break the shackle around my right arm and grab the demon’s face. It explodes as I smash it against the side of the altar, covering the surface in blood. I am the self, undisturbed, I am death, and the language I speak is violence. The objects coming to meet me encounter a vast consuming ocean and when they are swallowed there is not even a ripple.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c05" class="position" href="m.html#c05" title="The ‘I’ is unaffected by death.">c05</a></div>
		
<div>The Other is already dead, for the Absolute envelops all things. The objects I see that orbit the special object that is my body are finite entities that are already dying. That is what it means to be an other, ‘For only Others can die; man dies only as an Other, as He’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:273)</span>. I cannot die, I simply respawn and try again, while the death of my enemies is tied to the progress of the world in which they exist. The death my actions cause is only the fruition of a death that is already fundamental to the objects surrounding my body as others. The deaths these others experience, their plunging into the naught, is unfathomable to me. I cannot comprehend it beyond the maintaining of the self – expressed as ‘Me!’ – that is as wide as eternity and when things die, regardless of their proximity to the special object that is my body, they are absorbed into the stillness of the naught that is me.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c06" class="position" href="m.html#c06" title="Death is an affirmation of the self.">c06</a></div>
		
<div>I cannot die now, but when I die it will be the ultimate affirmation of self and this is how violence directed towards myself is to be understood, a movement towards the infinite stillness. B=B is the equation Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:69)</span> assigns to human selfhood and no human state expresses this notion more fully and truly than that of the corpse. The violence I experience is indeed a halting of my agency by an outside force, but it is also a gesture that reduces the virtual lines or potentialities connected to my body, a foreshadowing of their eventual coalesce when all becomes still. Such stillness is the self’s source. This death occurs eschatologically, at the end of the game when all sixteen colossi have been slain and no others remain to be consumed and the silent words are spoken, ‘it is finished’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Ueda <a href="5.html#Ueda 2005" target="_blank" title="Ueda F (director) (2005) Shadow of the colossus [videogame]">2005</a>)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="c07" class="position" href="m.html#c07" title="We are still shooting Nazis.">c07</a></div>
		
<div>The unconditional surrender of German forces was signed on May 7, 1945, ending the Second World War in Europe <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Parker <a href="5.html#Parker 2001" target="_blank" title="Parker RAC (2001) The Second World War: a short history">2001</a>:223)</span>, but I am still shooting Nazis. Inside a large ship, I am sitting in a wheelchair <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Matthies <a href="5.html#Matthies 2017" target="_blank" title="Matthies J (director) (2017), Wolfenstein II: the new colossus [videogame]">2017</a>)</span>. Guns are firing on the other side of the bulkhead opposite me. I roll towards a wounded comrade resting on the threshold that separates me from the action. He says, ‘Take this. They’re looking for you’, and hands me a ‘machinepistol’. I don’t hesitate to awkwardly roll through the door in my wheelchair and casually gun down the Nazi at the end of the hall. Somehow the war is still happening, and the command of some field officer at the beach on D-Day to ‘Fire on the enemy!’ is crystallised and endures through history and technology and I find myself hearing and obeying. I am not shooting a man, I am shooting some remnant of an ideology that has culminated in the form of a man, a collection of pixels displayed on my monitor as a picture I can manipulate to convey the death of an idea that people believed in and died for. However, for that reason, this is real violence and I am shooting a man. He died eighty years ago, and I shot him today.</div>
