<h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Review</h3>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>This essay will contain major spoilers for the original 1997 video game, Final Fantasy VII, and the 2020 Remake. I've tried to avoid spoiling the latest installment, released this year, called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. But there will be some minor spoilers in the forms of the visuals I show and what's necessary for the concepts I'll be discussing. Where possible, I use examples from the original Final Fantasy VII to make my points. If you've never played that game, I recommend it. But if you don't plan on playing it, this essay may prepare you with the context necessary to appreciate Rebirth and even video games more generally, albeit with a disappointment in the state of the gaming industry. I hope you'll soon see what I mean.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>In twenty-seven years, when the project of remaking Final Fantasy VII (in its current form) is as old as the original Final Fantasy VII is today, will this multi-video-game-console-generation-spanning-remake be getting a remake? Will Square Enix, or whoever owns them in 2051, remake the remake? Will the kids of today remember playing the latest installment, called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and have nostalgia for what now functions as an elaborate pandering to our nostalgia? I don’t want to try and predict what a particular video game might become to certain generations of gamers, but I will say that however Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is remembered, whatever its contributions to the medium, this game has not “remade” the original's impact. This isn’t a criticism either, because it certainly isn’t trying to; the performance of the game is aware of its non-equivalence with its source material to such a painful extent that this realisation has seeped and grown within the divergent retelling of the original story itself.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>It goes like this: Final Fantasy VII Remake was released in 2020 and initially posed as a faithful retelling of the first act of the original, a straight 'remake'. However, the introduction of a new plot device revealed Remake to not be the remake we were expecting:</div> 
	<blockquote><span class="small">Whispers. Perhaps best described as arbiters of fate. They are drawn to those who attempt to alter destiny’s course and ensure they do not.</span></blockquote>
	<div>Let’s say these whispers are a diegetic analogue of the loyalist fans demanding an accurate retelling, against the creative impulses of the developers and their desire to tell a new story. Cloud and his companion’s struggle against the whispers at each instance of the story’s divergence from the original, is a reflection of the developer’s struggles to fulfill fan’s expectations. At Remake's conclusion, it remained to be seen which force would win out in this struggle between nostalgia and new visions; though the finale seemed to suggest a breaking away from destiny and the opening up of more possibilities in its sequel, Rebirth. Now having experienced the remake's continuation, it's clear those expectations failed to appreciate the depth of the Final Fantasy VII remake project’s existential crisis.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The high cost of production and the success of the original Final Fantasy VII made it a risky proposition for Square Enix to deviate significantly from the established narrative, as it could alienate the dedicated fanbase. In both Final Fantasy VII Remake and its sequel, Rebirth, risky creative liberties were taken but Rebirth didn’t cash in on the potential for innovation it inherited from the game before it. This is a controversial thing to say in the context of Rebirth’s universal acclaim. However, I don’t see this as a criticism of the game itself, but as a symptom of the discourse around video games as commodities, and the narrow space made available to developers for the exploration of new concepts within that space.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>This is not a review of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth to tell you whether or not you should buy or play the game. This is a review of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for video games. It sets out to discover, against Rebirth, new ways of thinking about video games as a whole, to open up their possibilities. So here we are putting this remake to task for its identity as a video game, to see what it has contributed to the medium generally as a human practice. What does this game do for the possibilities and potentialities of interactive media? We will see how Rebirth is constrained by a definition of video games being imposed upon it, which regards video games as consumer products, over and in a way that hinders their status as lived inter-human events.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Rebirth is another performance of that deep tension, not at all unique to video games, between the power of familiar old stories, including their safeness and appeal as consumer products, their ability to generate money, against the demands of the Real for something new. This problem is not unique, but video games constitute a special case because their economic value is not only drawn from their contributions to creative cultural discourse in the way literature, fine art and (often) cinema are. Video games are also appraised through the lens of technics. Whatever a video game’s art status, it is also a technological demonstration, a manifestation of what is currently possible with the computer hardware available during development. The cutting-edge advancements always hold appeal, and are the engine driving much of game development, especially from industry leaders--indie games will be a reoccurring exception here. Hence the appeal of remakes.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Film studios have sequels and adaptations for their safe financial bets, none of which are necessarily creatively bankrupt because the art is still remade in each instance, and it only must lean on a familiar intellectual property to help it gain mass appeal. Risk-averse game studios have an apparently even safer option in addition to the above: because of the imprint of the current technological limitations present in each video game, and the way that technology affects how the game is experienced so fundamentally, and the way we appraise them is so closely married to a technological progressivism, game publishers are turning increasingly to remakes in which the creative human event of the video game image is superseded by modern graphics and quality of life improvements. As the medium of video games matures, the number of classic video games with a fidelity disproportionate to the capabilities of modern hardware increases. If Ocarina of Time or Chrono Trigger or Metal Gear Solid are such masterpieces, if they really stand as some of the best experiences video games have to offer, they stand as an implicit critique of the necessity of advancements in computing, which is one of the pillars of video game marketing. The industry’s answer, then, is remakes.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Remasters and rereleases or ports are an appeasement to the cultural legacy we place on these titles. They are rarely given the necessary resources or effort for a faithful conversion. The fact that voluntary fan-driven emulation or decompilation projects are often the best way to experience these games speaks to this. Game publishers’ real response to the continuing cultural impact of their intellectual properties is increasingly often a remake because it entails less risk than a sequel or an entirely new project from an industry auteur, while still being graphically impressive. Remakes also entail less risk for the customer too because of their familiarity or reputation. And the line separating remake and remaster can be a blurry one but here I’m going to say that a “remake” is when a classic game is created anew to take advantage of current hardware. But this is a definition I will only maintain for the present discussion.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The way we think and talk about video games is making space for the development of all these remakes. And I’m not interested in performing a genealogy or a history of this style of thought to situate it in a broader techno-late-capitalist milieu. This would be a productive exercise according to the intellectual discourse of the academy, positioning the video game within a socio-cultural and historical context. But it would not be a productive exercise according to the video game. The reason for this is that the video game entails a different style of thought and has a different order of operations. By this, I mean that video games are experienced as immanent events, which then determine how an image is resolved. Video games think according to the next action or event; this is how we play video games. For all the importance we place on video game images, play proceeds each image. To think about video games within a certain cultural context is to generate a conceptual image that holds and determines the video game. It sets up a space in which the video game can move, according to the model we have given it. The video game has not yet been given room to determine itself and the adjacent discourse has not yet been made to answer to the experience of gaming. Most conversation about video games only knows how to regard them as images, not even always interactive images, but the essence of the video game is the emancipation of the image through its metamorphosis into an event. This brief description is not a formal argument for why and how video games ought to be thought of differently. I only touch on it here to say that our definition and understanding of these inter-human events can limit what we do with them. And surely the prevalence of remakes might be taken as a symptom, that our current default model for thinking about video games is constrained. But rather than philosophically unpacking that, to liberate the video game from above, which risks only then placing it inside a new container, I'm more interested in finding a way to let the video game think for itself. Or better, to think the discourse according to video games, especially as we find it evinced in remakes like Rebirth.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Final Fantasy VII has spawned what is probably the most elaborate, extensive and ambitious remake project in the history of gaming. The concept and scope of it are the ultimate expressions of the gaming industry’s current prioritizations, which is to capitalize on past successes while demonstrating the latest technologies (Nintendo is an exception and only does the former). And despite this remake project's willingness to add additional plot and gameplay elements, as previously mentioned, the conservative formula is still being applied here; give us what we know, in a way that is bigger and better than we remember. How else are they to deploy these relentless advancements in computing? They revisit the past in a cyclical fashion to make it now new again. The technology that makes video games possible, for the sake of its continuing progress and existence, gives this medium a strange insecurity about its history. The object of much of the industry's strivings, namely graphical realism, only makes the past look uglier, and it must be remade. So, Square Enix takes the ugliest critically and commercially successful game in their catalog--not just ugly through a comparison to modern graphics, but philosophically ugly for its success despite the janky hodgepodge graphics that were always a bit off because they happened in the transition to new 3D technologies--Square Enix takes this contradiction, this game whose existence is itself a critique of many of the industry's current priorities, and they remake it as hard as they can, to decimate the implicit argument against fancy graphics that is Final Fantasy VII's existence.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>And I acknowledge the desire often evident in video game remake projects to enhance and not dismiss the artistry and intentionality of the original work, even within the limitations of its original hardware. But these intentions are couched in the context of a question, which is whether to prioritize old instances of the video game’s happening or to enable--make more comfortable and accessible--new instances. But the video game is never treated here as an event that is always remade each time you play it and is instead thought of as an object we need to do something to, an object we think about and make decisions for, and sell and purchase and remake or henceforth replace. But video games, in the playing and developing of them (which are not distinct processes), are their own events, their own kind of decisions and their own kind of thought. Video games think already, before we think about them, in a way that is fundamental to their nature, and resistant to the logic of remakes, which seeks to frame them as objects, hold them still, stop them from thinking. This resistance is manifest in the remaking of Final Fantasy VII.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>How could such a maximalist expression of video games, not expose what it is as a video game? For how long can a video game happen before it tries to think in the ways only video games can? You can only confine video games to the familiar grounds of nostalgia and fan service for so long before the process of development, or even in anticipation of so much development and the reality of that dearth of thought or creativity, causes a rupture. Rebirth’s departures from its source material feel restrained and confused enough to be an involuntary burst, or a concession to appease this primal aspect of the video game proper, which cannot survive on the diet of shareholders. And this is even more fitting because fighting against corporate greed is a central theme of the original Final Fantasy VII, so of course the remake project couldn’t help but be this strange critique of itself.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Rebirth is a signal to start thinking and talking about video games differently. This is true of every video game; there has always been this frustrating insufficiency in language that tries to translate the experience of a video game into itself. This is because video games entail a human experience that cannot be reduced to language, but we feel like it ought to be. No one really expects this of music, and I don’t mean music that is listened to but music that is played. Even though every video game is played before it is seen, we only know how to think about video games according to the modes of other mediums–-and this can be true of video games themselves, especially remakes, so that they constitute a confused event, lacking commitment to the novelty or essence of the medium. We bracket the different art forms within the experience in which our language can find purchase. The story is treated separately from the music which is separate from the visuals. Even gameplay is regarded as a tool, for the user, to make them have fun. There is very little space in the public discourse around video games for the video games themselves, as dialogic inter-human image events, to be discovered. Not that it needs to be discovered, we already have it, we play and value video games in a way that is not wholly dependent on the discourse surrounding them. However, games like Rebirth exist because of that discourse; Rebirth represents video games’ captivity within the prism of language which overdetermines and underestimates them.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a video game that does not know what it is. It obviously still, like Remake before it, can’t decide whether to be a sequel of Final Fantasy VII or a remake and so is attempting to straddle both. But more importantly, like all remakes, it doesn’t know what it is as a video game. It’s so full of images of video games, there are open worlds, romance options, mini-games, crafting, skill trees, outfits, vehicles, puzzles, climbing, collectibles, side quests, multiple playable characters, faithful reimaginings of its source material and interesting departures from it, all of it in this single, deep and wide, maximalist expression of today’s AAA gaming landscape. But is it actually thinking along those lines with us, is it picking any of them up, or is it merely showing us a great many things we already like? The gold saucer isn't the only amusement park in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth; this entire game is an amusement park. Each town is full of tourists having fun and Cloud and his friends feel like costumed characters. The experience is interactive, but interactivity alone doesn’t evince thought, at least not with originality, not like what I will identify in the original Final Fantasy VII. Though many of the same staff from the original Final Fantasy VII are working on the remake project, my complaint here is not for lack of ambition but for a lack of video game concepts which are Rebirth’s own, not borrowed from other mediums, other games or past instances.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Final Fantasy VII was released in 1997 and we still haven’t come to terms with it, with what makes the experience of this video game so affecting. This is not for lack of analyses but for how these analyses get in the way of the game itself, to form a kind of resistance. For example, we might analyze the game this way:</div>
	<blockquote><span class="small">Cloud's character arc is a penetrating critique of the hyper-masculine power fantasy, particularly prevalent in video games in the nineties. We perform him as the main playable character and experience his tuff-guy attitude and giant phallic sword in a way that is later undercut by the revelation that Cloud is delusional. He has confused his identity with someone else through the trauma of the authoritarian structures he aspired to be a part of. This facade also shields him from past failings to be that traditional hero and save the people he loves from injury or death. The game gives us this power fantasy, only to take it away to reveal the truth of its vulnerable state, that he is only a puppet. Tifa saves Cloud by helping him rediscover his true self, his true strength, and Cloud is able to assume a healthier form of masculinity in which feelings are expressed and accepted. This allows Cloud to rediscover his past, and that he was able to keep his promise and and be there for Tifa despite and not because of his strivings for status within an oppressive authoritarian system.</span></blockquote>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>This is just one of many possible readings of Final Fantasy VII. But any reading will treat the game as a static text, so all need to be flagged as forms of resistance to the video game itself. Everything I just attempted to convey through language to stand for the video game has already been shown by Final Fantasy VII itself, in a way that is incommensurable with my representation of it. It's true that video games entail representations too, they are images, but they are unresolved, incomplete images still happening. When the video game is regarded in this way, what I call an 'image-event', it is its own explanation of itself. Readings of video games like the one above are still welcome, but they are instances of a thought foreign to the video game; they do not circumscribe or determine their objects. Rather, these analyses come out of and are determined by video games. A true response to the thought unique to Final Fantasy VII can only be another video game. And it's a thought we can feel Rebirth grasping towards, with how it departs from the original, but the imperative of the remake project is getting in the way so that the thought cannot even discover itself. There is so little room for a video game to exist in the project of a remake.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Perhaps the greatest form of resistance to Final Fantasy VII is the longing for it to be remade. It's true that video games don't come out of nowhere, and that the above description of Cloud's masculinity might change the way you experience Final Fantasy VII next time you play it. And, of course, the development of games is influenced by the discourse surrounding them too. But this is not how video games think, it's not how you think while you're playing a video game. Video games are pure, ahistorical, action images. When we try to reposition them into other forms of public discourse, the interactivity and spontaneity of the image-event, what sets video games apart from other mediums, the video game itself, always gets left behind. Again, there is nothing wrong with making these kinds of transfers, but they ought not to feed deterministically back into video game development because they are almost always mistaken about what a video game is. Remakes are the epitome of this circular force that is hindering creativity in the gaming industry. The thing about remakes is, they are video games, but they are also interpretations of their source material, types of resistance to the video game proper.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Why are gamers so defensive about the art status of video games? Just because we can think about video games in the same way we think about art, this does not mean they themselves are art. The definition of art can be very broad and it's easy to include video games in that, especially when we think about performance art. But usually, the video game's art status is argued for in defense of the medium's cultural value. People want video games to be taken as seriously as other older forms of entertainment like film and literature. Though it might sometimes be a useful exercise to think about video games in that mode, it also occludes what is most interesting about them and encourages us to think about video games as if they were merely cinema plus interactivity. But that interactivity changes the lived experience qualitatively from top to bottom so that anyone imposing a cinematographic reading onto a video game has lost their intended object from the start. It's better to follow Hideo Kojima here, to say video games are not art but they do contain art. They are able to generate art, even in the playing of them, in such dynamic, unrestrained and interesting ways because they themselves are not art. Video games entail a thought strange enough to those old modes, they require enough of a radical shift, that it's better to lob that whole issue off at the head, to make room for a different form of discourse to immerge, which throws art instances into worlds experienced as images. Then art can become mobilized and deployed at the whim of developers or players within the video game image. This kind of play is impossible for a remake like Rebirth because it's too busy performing a static rendition of Final Fantasy VII as if that game were a piece of art one can simply make again to the same effect, this time with better technology.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The characters in Rebirth are expanded from the original with cutscenes and side quests and dialogue that explores their backgrounds. This is all fine, but it begs the question of how these characters became so familiar to us and how we got so invested in them in the first place. There is an economy to the original, a conciseness to each of the characters' stories that makes them especially poignant. And these lean narratives have been bloated in the remake project in the style of a TV series, where we experience characters over extended time to create a familiarity. But now the primary mode in which we experience them no longer belongs to the video game. The video game will accept any art we put into it, this is to say it can do it, sure, and it can even do it well. However, nothing about the original characters of Final Fantasy VII is getting "remade" here, and it's important that we don't feign their equivalence or even enhancement in the way Rebirth wants us to. Most of the time spent with Cloud and his companions in the original was spent playing them, with the gameplay systems. That gameplay informed our impression of the characters first, and the story felt like an extension of those played identities. Even during story moments, the characters look like they need to look in order for us to be able to play them on the original PlayStation hardware. So, it feels like a story about these played identities. But Rebirth wants these high-fidelity assets, already established, to be able to be played; there is an image already in mind, that it wants us to be able to play with. In this sense, advancements in computer hardware have allowed the video game to submit itself to be more and more determined by the image. Now, the combat in Rebirth does have a lot of depth and each character does play uniquely, but the cinematographic and graphical presentation of those characters is so effective, it's so loud, that the gameplay feels like a concession in which we get to play as those characters that have already been established, not by the original Final Fantasy VII, but by the high-budget cutscenes and iconography already established by the remake project.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Fancy graphics and cutscenes can be very effective elements of a video game, but they ought to echo the impressions of the identities we experience in other parts of the game, rather than determining them. I say "ought to" because I find games that embrace their nature as video games more interesting and generous to the medium, and not to say games that fail in this regard are somehow invalid or inferior. They can be just as fun, but they are moving along different lines, old lines, those of other mediums. But again, realistic or high-fidelity visuals don't inherently mean these elements determine all others in the expression of that video game. For example, The Last of Us Part II's story and characters portray a cruelty and violence already present in the taxing and gruesome gameplay loop. We could say Ellie is a violent character because the game has required us to play her in a violent way; the story and portrayal of her character are a sort of response to that. So, we see different art forms being deployed in ways that support each other, but those elements unique to video games are leading in The Last of Us Part II. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, as a remake, only knows how to follow: it's either following a fantasy about the original Final Fantasy VII or it's following the conventions of current triple-A action RPGs. Now, this has created an interesting mixture at times, but it also leaves us with a game that is confused about its own identity. In this confusion and despite how entertaining it is, this game is a symptom of the industry's fear of the video game unrestrained, moving on its own terms.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>And I should add that even the original Final Fantasy VII held this tension between the movement of the video game itself and the industry's aspirations. For example, there is a big difference between the cutscenes using the low poly character models and the prerendered movies. In 1997, the spectacle of the latter was no doubt impressive, but it also held a promise that one day we'd play a Final Fantasy in which the entire game looked like this. We're so far beyond that in 2024, that the old prerendered movies have a completely different effect. They no longer hold any promise of what's to come and instead reveal this video game's dissatisfaction, it's desperate reaching outside itself, to be more than what it is when played. One can't help but be slightly embarrassed for the game feeling like it needed to resort to such images; like they evince some shame or insecurity within the game itself.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>But despite this, Final Fantasy VII still manages to do interesting things with gameplay in the telling of its story. Those reachings for an idealized realism don't prevent the video game from applying its essence to the material at hand. They don't prevent the video game from applying its essence to the art forms being deployed within the video game image, even prerendered movies. For example, in the lead-up to Aerith's death, we can't stop Cloud from approaching her, not because we are watching a movie but because the familiar inputs only register movements towards Aerith. When we push the button to interact with her, Cloud unexpectedly raises his sword. This is particularly effective for and supports the reading of Final Fantasy VII's story I presented earlier. Cloud is physically abusive to Aerith, in a way that ultimately, albeit indirectly, causes her death. If he had been able to approach her in a non-violent way, he might have been able to save her. And the game's interactivity pulls players into the experience of Cloud's violent personality as Cloud experiences it, as a confusion and lack of control. We play Cloud with a naivety that immerses us in the character's own obliviousness, in isolation from the reality of his past and true identity. Then the movie of Sephiroth murdering Aerith plays in a way that distances his actions from Cloud's because it happens in a different, non-interactive mode. The lack of interactivity in the cutscene aligns thematically with the experience of that game's other elements, namely its story, characters and themes. This blending of story and image through interactivity enhances how each element is experienced. In this way, Final Fantasy VII is committed to discovering its own possibilities as an image, as a story and as interactive media.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>In contrast to this creative mixture of art forms, Rebirth seems much less interested in discovering what this medium can do to how we experience its story and images. While the original pushed boundaries, Rebirth remains fixated on the image it is tasked with remaking. This is to say it treats Final Fantasy VII as an image rather than a video game. To understand why this distinction matters, consider the essence of playing a video game: when you're engaged with a game, your primary concern is the next image that will unfold based on your actions. In that moment of play, you're not discussing or merely observing, but actively participating in the creation of the next visual state. You have a role to play in how that next image emerges and can influence, within the parameters of the software, what it turns out to be. We can apply this same logic in broader strokes, to the image that is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: this is not an image-event in the way I just described because it has already been determined. This video game is capitalizing on an old thought, one already achieved and still being thought in the original Final Fantasy VII. In doing so, it hinders any new ideas it might be trying to have. Despite the convoluted changes and additions to the story, most of this game is a tech demo expanded to a preposterous scale. It's a tech demo in the sense that every remake is a tech demo, were it not for new technologies these remakes would have little to contribute. Even in its additional plot elements and gameplay mechanics like skill trees and crafting, these are all to show or demonstrate something, they are not from the source of an impulse to act within the image itself. I can't say there is no creativity present, but the origin of every remake is insecurity about the past for a technological progressivism. Final Fantasy VII's remake project doesn't let the video game think because it's too busy pushing it into a predetermined shape.</div>

	<div>Some philosophers are for both reading and flexing. People like to make known that they're reading (and understanding) Heidegger, they like to put Deleuze and Guatari on their Goodreads or make that yellow spine of Hegel's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Hegel 1807" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span> <em>Phenomenology</em> prominent on their book shelf. The Dymocks in Melbourne had to put all their Nietzsche books in a locked glass cabinet because people kept steeling them — so these books must enjoy some special status beyond their philosophical content, which is online for free, to make them worth stealing. Iconic white old men like these will reliably impress both friends and strangers alike. Less iconic, deeper cuts will be more impressive to any observers who recognise the material. For example, Edith Wyschogrod could get you more points than Žižek but only if you manage to be seen by someone who recognises her work.</div>

	<div>Laruelle represents an extreme case in the above book boasting guidelines because he's so sophisticated but challenging, subversive but obscure and provocative but niche that it’s not worth the effort for a recognition that will probably never come. Books like <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy</em> are not for flexing. They are only for reading, if you can, and if you can, because you've gained something rare, they ought to be for something else too, if not for a broader research project than at least for a review. But I don’t think of this as a review. Reviews usually assume a transcendent posture akin to philosophy. Anyway, to what standard could we measure a text so singular in its mission? Rather, this is me trying to help carve a path into the text for you; I’m trying to show you a way in but without the constraints a formal introduction to Laruelle would impose – there’s too much ground there to cover. This is me practicing explaining what in Laruelle’s thought I find so compelling. And I perform it as a bounce off <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy,</em> so as to say, ‘this book is a big deal; let me try and show you how’. So, this is my non-review of <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy</em> by François Laruelle, first published in French in 1989 and translated into English by Taylor Adkins in 2013. And because this book is the first instance of Laruelle's articulation of his non-philosophy, what follows can also serve as an informal initial exposure to this non-standard thought, which tolerates no real ‘introduction’, only a happening.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.3" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=135" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>These things considered, it shouldn’t surprise us that there's only one written review of <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy</em> on Amazon. It's titled 'Guaranteed Unintelligible' and says:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">Author promises unless you already know what he's talking about, you will not be able to understand this book. Author keeps his promise!</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Thinlydisguised <a href="#Thinlydisguised 2016" title="Thinlydisguised (24 August 2016) 'Guaranteed unintelligible'">2016</a>)</span></blockquote>
	<div>There are two written reviews on Goodreads. One user reviews favourably with a five star rating, but the other describes a harrowing experience with the text:</div>
		 <blockquote><span class="small">i do realize it's supposed to be playful/jokey but taylor adkins' translator's introduction to 'philosophy and non-philosophy' singlehandedly caused me to never read laruelle, and then completely reject my entire metaphysics i'd been nurturing for years (centered around pure immanence).</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(channel <a href="#channel 2023" title="channel (10 December 2023) 'Shelved as dnf'">2023</a>)</span></blockquote>
	<div>I enjoyed Adkins' introduction but was at an advantage, having read three other books by Laruelle prior. It's not introductory material for someone unfamiliar with his work or without a substantial background in philosophy. So, I'm not surprised it scared this person away. They go on to describe their experience with the text's difficulty:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">something here though crossed the line from 'a challenge, but the texture of the challenge is necessary to lead somewhere rewarding' to what i could only receive as a genuine sadism exceeding some semiotic pain tolerance i apparently have. i was pretty indignant about it.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(channel <a href="#channel 2023" title="channel (10 December 2023) 'Shelved as dnf'">2023</a>)</span></blockquote>
	<div>They finish with a description of how they got into the occult and switched majors from physics to engineering... It's an incredible review.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.4" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=NYXM-jwdAC5W82SF&t=217" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>There's one other review of <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy,</em> which I found published in the <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,</em> written by Ian James <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#James 2013" title="James I (2013) 'Philosophy and non-philosophy'">2013</a>)</span>. But I might return to that later when I can bring the force of the concepts I'll be describing to bear on the criticisms therein, though it is a generally favourable review. For now, I'll replace it with a mention of Graham Harman's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Harman 2011" title="Harman G (2011) 'Philosophies of difference: a critical introduction to non-philosophy', review of Philosophies of difference: a critical introduction to non-philosophy">2011</a>)</span> infamous review of the book Laruelle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Laruelle 1986" title="Laruelle (1986/2020) Philosophies of difference: a critical introduction to non-philosophy">1996/2020</a>)</span> published three years earlier, <em>Philosophies of Difference.</em> Harman's review of <em>Philosophies of Difference</em> will serve here to represent the extreme end of a general sentiment, which obstructs new readers as much as anything Laruelle is responsible for in his prose or ideas; it is the notion that his work is too hard and not worth the effort required to understand it.</div> 

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.5" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=254" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>In his review, Harman combines a misreading of the text, with complaints about the prose's intelligibility, with a doubt that the 'payoff is sufficient to warrant the effort'. I don't blame Amazon or Goodreads reviewers for expressing their inability to understand the text, they fulfilled the assignment of those platforms by describing their subjective experiences; they didn't even have to show up at all. However, Harman has no excuse. He was supposed to do his homework for this review, but as one of Laruelle's English translators, Adam Kotsko, points out in a reactionary blog post:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">... there is something altogether reckless and disrespectful about writing a review that suggests that even if the philosopher being harshly reviewed could respond to all the criticisms put forward, well, so what?</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ktosko <a href="#Ktosko 2011" title="Ktosko A (15 August 2011) 'So what?: on Graham Harman's abominable review of Laruelle's Philosophies of difference'">2011</a>)</span></blockquote>
	<div>Criticisms like Harman's lose their force once you become used to Laruelle's style and know his broad intentions. They are complaints people throw from a distance to save them the trouble of having to fully engage with a work. But they only speak to those unfamiliar with non-philosophy. If I can show you what Laruelle's really up to, objections like Harmen's, while perhaps still amusing in certain respects, will ultimately prove intellectually uninteresting. Even if you disagree with Laruelle, a surface level understanding of his project will expect from detractors a response of proportionate sophistication.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.6" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=1gbZ8caO-sZJSSq7&t=384" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>We can at least say this much: non-philosophy is not philosophy. Non-philosophy is a science and therefore needs its object of inquiry, its material, to think with. If science in general wishes to define itself it inevitably starts doing philosophy — a philosophy of science, in that order. But as praxis, science is uninterested in defining itself; this concern comes from philosophy and the need to overdetermined things according to their difference, define them to set their parameters. Lived science... (Certainly not scientism, which is a philosophy). Lived science, as it is practised, has only one concern: the description and discovery of its object according to certain axiomatic methods. If non-philosophy, as the science of philosophy, wishes to make itself known, a definition of its essence, a philosophy of this science, a philosophy of non-philosophy, would contradict its first principles. Non-philosophy, like everything else, would be subsumed by philosophy and become doubly hidden to us. For this reason, non-philosophy must not allow itself to become a philosophy by fulfilling readers’ philosophical expectations. Granted, there is a sense, beyond the scope of these introductory remarks, to which non-philosophy must still be philosophical, but it will strive to be the smallest and most deprived, and therefor least hallucinatory, form of philosophy it can be. But for our present purposes we'll say non-philosophy does not have the recourse of philosophy available to it, in the task of its propagation. This science cannot allow itself to become its object, namely philosophy, because then it would lose all perspective of it, becoming the thing it intends to work with, imprisoned as the prisoner it seeks to liberate.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.7" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=491" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>So, we will instead start in a non-standard way: you already know what non-philosophy is. You've never had to call it something, never thought to make it a thing, but you've been listening to me do it this whole time. The above, ‘rules of book boasting’ and general reactions to Laruelle’s thought, appear, from the perspective of philosophy to be a sort of naive second-order abstraction full of irreverent presuppositions. But from the perspective of our lived immanent given experience, it was completely natural to regard these philosophies as mere material to be compared for reasons foreign to the intentions and priorities of the works themselves. A non-standard inversion was performed, and we didn’t need any philosophical concepts to do it: we suspended philosophy's authority in order to regard it according to our lived experience. This much, philosophy can tolerate because the instant philosophy itself receives more careful attention, one of its configurations will emerge to claim sufficiency for the whole situation and beyond, it will claim to be enough to explain and account for everything.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.8" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=549" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The challenge of the project of non-philosophy — which Laruelle has discovered as a need evinced in the boring and repetitive practice of contemporary philosophy — doesn't lie in generating a non-philosophy in the broad sense, which is already immediately given. The challenge lies in preserving that initial mode we enjoyed at the beginning, preserving that self-sufficiency which doesn't answer to philosophical authority, and deploying it in a methodical, rigorous, scientific mode for philosophy, to give philosophy that thing which it so desperately needs, which will free it from itself. And we can't be for philosophy, we can't help liberate it from itself, liberate the human from its determinations, while being yet another philosophy.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.9" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=591" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>In the performing of this task, we will see the familiar language of philosophy deployed with new objectives and new rules. Philosophical texts can be challenging enough on their own, without this added emancipatory agenda subverting how that language is used. Some philosophy is accused of being too esoteric in its jargon in a way that unnecessarily isolates many readers. Pop-philosophy is sometimes posed as a response to this when it attempts to make philosophical concepts available to a more general audience – but isn’t there still a kind of condescending gesture in this? Laruelle takes things in the opposite direction, producing texts that are challenging for both philosophers and ‘non-philosophers’ alike. There is a democratizing aspect to the difficulty of Laruelle’s work, and inversely, an isolation in its comprehension. Laruelle’s so busy in amongst the technicalities of the deceptively complex and colossal task he's set for himself, that he rarely turns around to see if anyone's still following. If he was worried about things like that, he never would have come here.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.10" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=648" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>If Laruelle did turn around to discover a philosopher behind him, following along nicely, he would be disappointed; non-philosophy ought to be incomprehensible to philosophy. As he traverses the terrain of human thought (which he calls non-thetic transcendence or the (non-)One) Laruelle tries to move across it in ways that are non-philosophical, in ways that are impossible for the philosopher to follow. This doesn't mean coming up in opposition to philosophy — that’s not what the ‘non’ here is doing — but rather entails non-Euclidean trajectories along a plane inaccessible to philosophy. So, if philosophers aren't following (not philosophers personally but the philosopher inside each of us) that’s a good sign, a necessary feature of non-standard thought, even a guiding principle.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.11" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=692" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Because of our habits of thought, it’s easy to forget, and so worth emphasising, that non-philosophy doesn't use philosophy in the same way philosophy uses philosophy or regards itself. Non-philosophy gives philosophy a completely different function to what philosophy pre-decides for itself. This is a challenging notion because we have all been trained and are in the habit of thinking philosophically. But appreciating this early on can make you more sympathetic to Laruelle's efforts to, in a sense, lose the philosopher on his tale. It is non-philosophy so he's still moving through the same familiar rooms, it still looks like philosophy and is still philosophy in one sense, but it is no longer determined by philosophy. Rather, we say it is ‘determined by the One’.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.12" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=743" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>From the perspective of non-philosophy, philosophy has lost its authority and now functions as ‘support’ — it supports non-philosophy by offering itself as material and space to move in. Philosophy finds this perspective uninteresting and immediately subsumes it into whatever form the occasion dictates – be it Hegel, Kant, whatever. Philosophy’s default posture towards any thought practice seeking to mobilise it is the same; every philosopher is expert at subordinating such cases into their system of thought. Fair enough, but what if we discovered a thought practice, specifically for philosophy, that was so radically immanent that there just isn’t room for philosophy to move and fit ‘round the other side of it. Let’s say its so tightly pressed up against the lived decision that makes philosophical thought possible, that philosophy is necessarily oblivious to it. What is the unphilosophizable cause of all philosophy? What determines it 'in the last instance', that is, after all philosophical explanations are said and done? Philosophy is determined by ‘the One’ in the last instance – not a philosophically ambitious totalising One, rather this One, which is all there is. There is an immediate, finite, present, lived experience, ‘determined in the last instance’, inaccessible to philosophy, that philosophy can never be about, but which determines all philosophy and everything else: this is the One. Of course, non-philosophy is determined by the One too, the occasion always is, but unlike philosophy, non-philosophy submits to the One and accepts this determination in order to think philosophy according to the One. Inversely, philosophy hallucinates a thinking of the One without any support and according to its own authority. Philosophy fantasises a departure from the One into the generation of philosophical concepts. Thus, philosophy is in need of a divestment of the authority of these concepts, an acknowledgement of its determination by the One, the revealing of its transcendental support structures. Let them be discovered and revealed as an immanent chaos, to expand what we can do with philosophy. Non-philosophy is pure practice and non-authoritarian, its source and supports are declared at the outset, namely the One and philosophy respectively.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.13" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=877" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>This is an unnecessary and overcomplicated procedure from the perspective of philosophy.  And philosophy will eagerly stack the blame for these aspects of non-philosophy on Laruelle. But the non-philosopher, uninvested in philosophy as an institution of thought, will naturally throw the blame back at philosophy itself. The complexity of non-philosophy doesn't come from its axioms, which are necessarily simple, but from the complexity of its object and site of practice, namely philosophy. We can forgive densely complex prose when the thing it's describing is also densely complicated. We are used to thinking of specific philosophies as complicated; <em>Being and Time</em> is complicated because Being is a complicated question and Heidegger <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Heidegger 1927" title="Heidegger M (1927/2008) Being and time">1927</a>)</span> goes to great lengths to demonstrate this complexity at the outset. However, the decision to think philosophically is its own lived problem and cannot be posed by philosophy which has already made the decision.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.14" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=930" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Of course, philosophers love to ask the question, 'What is philosophy?':</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">The question what is philosophy? can perhaps be posed only late in life, with the arrival of old age and the time for speaking concretely...It is a question posed in a moment of quiet restlessness, at midnight, when there is no longer anything to ask. It was asked before; it was always being asked, but too indirectly or obliquely; the question was too artificial, too abstract. Instead of being seized by it, those who asked the question set out and controlled it in passing... There was too much desire to do philosophy to wonder what it was, except as a stylistic exercise.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze and Guattari <a href="#Deleuze 1972" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1972/2013) Anti-Oedipus: capitalism and schizophrenia">1972/2013</a>:1)</span></blockquote>
	<div>Yet despite this early lucid comment, Deleuze and Guattari were unable to exorcise the circular topology inherent in the gesture of philosophy, the deployment of a thought sufficient for the answering of that question, what is philosophy?, while simultaneously being the object in question. Does the question itself not evince some hallucinatory state when the thing in question is the asking of the question?</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.15" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=992" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>It is philosophy that concerns itself with questions like ‘What is philosophy?’. Philosophy labours over its presuppositions, while ignoring the decision it’s made in performing that work. Non-philosophy takes the existence of philosophy as given but is also indifferent to this existence – it doesn’t need it to be there to justify itself, philosophical material (and thus non-philosophy itself) was merely discovered.</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">… we do not have to philosophize it as having already taken place, but instead we have to know it, to produce knowledges oriented around it.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="#Laruelle 1994" title="Laruelle F (1994/2008) 'Laruelle's essay on simondon: the concept of a first technology'">1994/2008</a>)</span></blockquote>
	<div>Philosophy is an object that has emerged presently as a potential site where we can apply this science. But we are in the habit of assuming this topic of inquiry needs to be defined, including its reasons and its uses. As far as non-philosophy is concerned, philosophy is its own shown identity, which needs no further explanation. But asserting this against the standard inclinations is an uphill battle. The pattern philosophers find so exhilarating, which Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Deleuze 1968" title="Deleuze G (1968/2014) Difference and repetition">1968/2014</a>)</span> exposed in ‘The Image of Thought’, that is the revelation of presuppositions, needs to be globally shifted with a new vision. This can feel like we’re adding an extra step, a further abstraction or a philosophical doubling over, making the complexity of Laruelle’s project seem especially unreasonable and intolerable. But this is because we’re already doubled over, on the floor, burdened with this need to constantly fold each thought back in on itself with the celebrated reflexive posture. Despite how it presents itself there is nothing liberating about these appeals to a ‘self-awareness’.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.16" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1084" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Philosophy, and thought more generally, is used to being able to claim sufficiency for anything and everything it encounters, nothing is too strange or too large for at least a thought to encompass; the ‘force (of) thought’ resists all finitudes pertaining to its movements; it refuses all parameters imposed on it by subsuming them into itself. Philosophers are therefore understandably appalled at the non-standard inversion which refuses to be absorbed into any philosophy, and they are left with nothing to do with it. The mere existence of non-philosophy constitutes an automatic critique, a ‘real’ critique of philosophy’s circular motions, the authority it gives itself to determine all beings including itself, Being, the Parmenidean One, the cogito etc. Laruelle’s genius lies in what he discovered could be left on the table. When thought is unidirectional and uninterested in itself, when it thinks ‘once each time’, it can take on truly new, and previously unthinkable, forms.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.17" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1143" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>What is the shape of philosophy – the shape of this style of thought that cannot be discerned along its sanctioned paths? For non-philosophy to be the science it claims to be, having philosophies available to it as material, it makes a rule for itself that it cannot assume this shape; non-philosophy is never a circle and never folds back on itself.  This rule is not based on any philosophical arguments but rather must be accepted at the outset. No philosophical justification for it will be provided, though it always has already been proved according to the One. Ultimately, this is not an intellectual manoeuvre but a posture or vision of thought that is also a vision in accordance with radical immanence or the One. Laruelle calls this, ‘vision-in-One’. It’s like watching a screen and the content on the screen at the same time so as to divest the content of its claims to an ultimate reality. Then we can see the real shape of the image, that it transpires on a flat surface, or in philosophy’s case, the break from the real, its division, to fulfil its goals to circumnavigate itself. However, these structures of thought are so labyrinthine and elaborately built up, achieving and maintaining this vision can be difficult.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.18" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1214" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>How accessible you find <em>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy,</em> and all Laruelle’s works, will depend on three factors: (1) your tolerance for reading through parts you don’t understand, (2) your background in philosophy and (3) how attached you are to philosophical authority. While you’ll need a notion of philosophy's broad historical project and trends, a philosophical foundation, an awareness of the material that is going to be non-philosophy’s object, to follow what he’s doing, it's this very philosophical training that will need to be... not ‘unlearned’ but its authority will need to be given up, in a sense. So, there’s an irony here in that, anyone qualified enough to follow what Larruelle’s doing, is going to be less likely to forsake their philosophical training for professional, personal, maybe spiritual reasons. They have an investment in this enterprise and non-philosophy is really going to mess with it. We’re not going to kill philosophy, but we are going to upset some sacred sites. Doing so will require that we know their location, how to get there, etc. This means we can’t stop being philosophers; the labour of non-philosophy requires a vision of our dual status as both non-philosophers and philosophers — this time, in that exact order.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.19" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1284" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>What then would be the appeal of non-philosophy to the philosopher, the kind of person who is best equipped to understand it? It takes a specific kind of person to stumble upon and commit themselves to the labour of studying Laruelle. This is because it’s very difficult to communicate what non-philosophy actually does and what it’s for. Here it is: non-philosophy is for philosophy without being philosophy, it’s for humans without being a humanism. Everyone starts reading Laruelle for the fulfilment of some application or new philosophy. This is to say, they come to non-philosophy from philosophy, with philosophical expectations and demands. But non-Philosophy will not give them what they seek.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.20" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1324" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Laruelle’s work can be incredibly powerful at undermining the authority of deconstruction. This is how I came to non-philosophy, and how it was able to resolve many difficulties I had, while writing my PhD thesis about video games and anthropology, which, as I write this, is currently undergoing examination. Rather than deconstructing video games with a differentiating procedure that generates binaries, a common practice in anthropological literature, I was inspired by a different aspect of the medium. It was the potential for ethnography to allow the phenomena in question to determine how we go about understanding it. In the case of my dissertation, this meant assuming a posture open enough to permit video games to influence and even critique the anthropological method. To do this, I tried to put anthropology on the same level as video games, to frame anthropology as an image generating technology. Anthropology generates images, representations, even concepts of the human, as byproducts of its practice. Video games are a ready-made automatic ‘real’ critique of the reductions of the human inherent in the performance of anthropology. This critique comes out of the non-philosophical vision, vision-in-One, more easily achieved in video games than in anthropology or philosophy – though moving forward these two are not worth differentiating, anthropology is a child of philosophy, it looks up to philosophy for validation and aspires to become it; it thinks becoming more philosophical will sooth its colonialist guilt, but this point is tangential.</div>

	<div>But my purpose here is not to summarise my PhD, and I only bring it up for two reasons: (1) to show you a practical example of how Laruelle’s thought might be used and (2) because I think video games can make it easier to understand non-philosophy. Like video games (and of course like anthropology) philosophy is an image generating technology. Philosophy produces descriptions, images, of Being in the form of ontologies or Knowing in the form of epistemologies. Video games do this too, not only in the industry’s aspirations towards realism, but in the phenomenology of how we experience them. They generate immanent experiences that are extensions from a point of view; they produce transcendence.</div>

	<div>Both video games and philosophies generate worlds. Kant's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Kant 1781" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> transcendental idealism or Deleuze’s transcendental materialism, for example, are worlds with their own rules and textures in the same way <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> or <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are. The difference is that the insurmountable chasm dividing  video game worlds from the Real, that unidirectional difference separating them from the lived conditions that bring them about, the intuition that video games constitute another sphere of action that is not equivalent to immanent lived experience (more precisely it is not equivalent according to how we experience and value video games); well, philosophy feigns such an equivalence and actively resists being sublimated into cultural material. This is why Laruelle will sometimes say philosophy is hallucinatory, it hallucinates a reversibility back into the One, which is like a video game claiming to simulate, or perform a true reduction of, the entire Universe, including all other simulations or video games, including the conditions of its own development. It seems ridiculous when we’re talking about video games but this is really what, according to Laruelle, Philosophy does. This point often serves as his initial thesis, out of which the rest of non-philosophy matures:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">One philosopher does not succeed another without claiming to succeed philosophy itself as a whole. </span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="#Laruelle 1996" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:xxi)</span></blockquote>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="1.23" class="eposition" href="https://youtu.be/G-pWHLWblVo?si=xVmKqDKM6xjgpl81&t=1514" target="_blank" title="Watch this paragraph on YouTube">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The difference between video games and philosophy, in the way we are regarding them here, is that philosophy is a much older, more developed, sophisticated and complex technology. The whole enterprise of philosophy has become so elaborate in its efforts to resist being suspended as material, to resist being accountable and determined by ordinary, finite individuals that it has become worse than useless. It is an overbearing authority that we constantly submit the determination of our lives and thoughts to, these ancient structures always seeking to determine us and never to be determined by us. And the thought of putting philosophies to work, making them subject to our creative needs and whims, rarely happens. But Laruelle’s non-philosophy is that thought – more emancipatory than the anti-fascism of something like Anti-Oedipus, not for its superior deconstruction but for its simple, somewhat naive, materialism. In the same way we play, mod, emulate and break video games, and we do so necessarily as part of our enjoyment of them as mere material – video games have no authority over our lives but are worlds, constituting experiences determined by us – Laruelle is saying, let it be so too for philosophy. Let’s play philosophy like we play video games.</div>
