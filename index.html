	<div>This website is where I publish my independent research about video games and other things. My current project is to produce essays exploring how to think about video games in new ways. I take a lot of inspiration from the works of Fran√ßois Laruelle in these efforts and am in the process of reviewing each of his books. I respond to each book with an essay that is not necessarily a review and alternate these with essays challenging video game discourse.</div>

	<div>My PhD thesis is an interactive website, and can be experienced through the following link:</div>
