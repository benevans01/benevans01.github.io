	<div>Video games think on their own before we think about them. We do not need to give a type of intellectual analysis or artistic appraisal to them. They are their own best description of themselves, being both an image and an indeterminate inter-human event. Video games are their own type of thought. The discovery and enabling of which has the potential to be a radical displacement outside the institutions of representational philosophy.</div>
<br>
	<div>This website is a platform for the emancipation of the video game from two competing forces; its determination as a consumer product and its misrepresentation vis-à-vis other mediums. It also houses my broader philosophical research, including work on François Laruelle's non-philosophy, which informs and enriches my approach to understanding video games as autonomous forms of thought.</div>
