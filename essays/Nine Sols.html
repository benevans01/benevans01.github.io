	<br>

	<div>Struggling through <em>Nine Sols'</em> challenging gameplay has posed to me the perennial question of difficulty settings in video games. This topic has already been discussed and debated a great deal on the internet, but I want to approach it here in a different mode. This will be to discover a way of thinking about questions like ‘Should games have an easy mode?’, according to the video game. I will make clear what I mean by 'according to the video game' in the process of this essay. Such a posture will allow us to make the issue of difficulty and accessibility accountable to the experience of gaming. We'll move through the typical notions of the debate while inserting a radical intervention and subversion of standard conceptions of the essence of video games. To do this, many of the typical arguments against the necessity of easy modes in video games will be revisited. However, they will be placed in a new context: a radical and subversive imperative to think with video games, as inter-human events, rather than about them as discrete objects.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div><em>Nine Sols</em> is a 2D action-platformer; it has metroidvania elements and the combat takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</em> Though I've never played <em>Sekiro,</em> I've read that <em>Nine Sols'</em> parry system is similar to what's found in that game. The positive Steam reviews say <em>Nine Sols</em> is tough but rewarding and the negative reviews say it’s difficult and unfair. So, it seems as good a candidate as any to insert into the question of difficulty in gaming, though the typical case is a FromSoftware game. But <em>Nine Sols</em> has some differences that will help us think about the question of difficulty and accessibility in video games in new ways.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Though <em>Nine Sols</em> is a challenging game, unlike <em>Sekiro</em> or <em>Elden Ring,</em> it has a ‘story mode’, which can be switched to at any time, where the difficulty can be manually adjusted. This allows for the incremental adjustment of attack and injury multipliers and has the potential to generate an especially tailored playthrough for the user; it gives them a lot of power to determine their experience with the game. For example, you could start with both multipliers at 100% so that it plays as it would in standard mode, but tweak it as you go to find a difficulty you're comfortable with. And there’s also room with these settings to ‘break’ the game, that is, create a combat experience far removed from the standard mode and which plays completely differently. Because this setting is presented to the player against the standard mode, and the fact that these options are behind a settings menu, <em>Nine Sols</em> clearly communicates their place in relation to how the game was designed.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Are we justified in criticizing games that don't follow <em>Nine Sols</em> in this regard? Should we advocate for ‘easy modes’ against the practices of popular titles like <em>Sekiro,</em> <em>Elden Ring,</em> <em>Spelunky</em> or <em>Castlevania III?</em> Before exploring this question, an important distinction needs to be made with accessibility. Accessibility is a frequently cited case for the necessity of easy modes. However, accessibility and difficulty settings are not always the same thing. This is because not all accessibility options are to do with a game’s difficulty or make it easier for people who don't need them. These include text-to-speech, high-contrast modes or visual cues for audio events. But there is an overlap because many of the accessibility options someone with a physical or cognitive disability might need, also happen to make the game easier, like adjustable game speed, aim assists or in <em>Nine Sols’</em> case, attack and injury multipliers.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>So, the difference between accessibility settings and difficulty settings in these overlapping cases comes down to how they are presented, it is an issue of appropriate communication through which the developer can impose certain expectations on the player. But before determining how these settings might be conveyed in a way that matches the dynamic and emancipatory nature of the video game, a justification for 'easy modes', however they're presented to the player, will first need to be discovered. Their necessity will need to be discovered according to the video game, that is, according to gameplay, the lived experience of playing a video game. Once that is established, it will become clear how these settings ought to be communicated. Both these tasks will be an invitation to the video game to come into further accordance with itself.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Before going through the common justifications people give in defence of games without an easy mode, their right to not have one, the video game itself needs to be better defined. This will allow us to see if the arguments align with the video game's fundamental nature. Here are the aspects of the video game to be imposed on the discourse, to make the discourse answer to the experience of gaming: video games are dynamic, inter-human, dialogic image-events. 'Dynamic', because video games, when they happen, are in a state of constant change. Never mind the parameters set up during development; developing a video game involves playing it, so playing and developing are not distinct processes. Modding and speed running are enough to show how the perceived limits of a game can be broken outside the scope of development. 'Inter-human', because video games are of the interactions between people and involve the indeterminateness of humans the whole time they are happening. 'Dialogic', because they are a kind of back-and-forth dialogue where the event of the video game resides in neither party but in the 'in-betweenness' described by Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>; <a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>)</span>. 'Image-event', because for all these ways just described in which the video game constitutes an event, it also entails an image. This image, by also being an event, is always new and can only be determined in the last instance by the player, despite how a developer or hardware might limit its possibilities. These are the aspects of the video game, presented here as a means of pointing to its essence, which we will use to test arguments against the necessity of easy modes.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Many justifications for the absence of an easy mode in video games do not constitute coherent arguments and can be safely dismissed for this essay. For instance, sharing footage of a physically disabled person beating <em>Demon's Souls</em> using only their feet or mouth or somthing, followed by the imperative to 'git gud,' is both reductive and ableist (this is a made up example but I've seen things to this effect). Such cases oversimplify the complex issue of game accessibility and disregard the diverse spectrum of abilities among players, erroneously suggesting that one person's exceptional achievement negates the need for broader inclusivity in gaming. And cases like this don't even have a direct connection to the necessity of an easy mode's absence, they might just as easily be deployed as a means of discouraging people from choosing easy modes at the select screen.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Another common appeal for the exclusion of easy modes points to the finite resources of video game development. Development entails decisions about where to direct resources during production and many developers, especially indie developers, should not be made to prioritize features like easy modes at the expense of others more important to their vision of the game. But this only responds to a different argument, which very few people are making, that every game should be made to have an easy mode. The real issue is more abstract and asks whether easy modes should be a standard we expect in the industry along the same lines as graphical settings. We can forgive their absence under certain contexts, but the expectations are generally imposed, and these settings are always viewed as a good feature to include. Larger game studios, like FromSoftware, are held especially accountable in this regard. So, the question is if we can also be justified in criticizing these studios for not including an 'easy mode', and what reasons for their absence should we accept. A small studio lacking resources is an easy exception to point to, but it only distracts us from the larger issue, which asks, 'What is the ideal?'</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>With that sort of rhetoric out of the way, we can distil the arguments against easy modes into two main interconnected points. But before describing them, I want to acknowledge that I haven't conducted anything close to an exhaustive review of the 'literature'. These essays are intended to be fast experiments in thinking with video games and not comprehensive academic treatments or definitive statements on video game discourse. But even a trivial perusal will reveal two main repeating arguments, which are connected, both leaning on a particular conception of the video game that is completely at odds with how it was described above. I hope my portrayals of these arguments can serve for the purposes of this essay, but they are intended to work here as broad strokes for a representation of the discourse rather than specific arguments made by individuals.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The first makes a case for the preservation of the developer's intentions. Because video games are a creative art form, it's valid for artists to impose a specific experience on the audience who have volunteered into its consumption. It hinders the medium's creative potential, for its artists to have to carry certain expectations and taboos into the exploration of their craft. We are not in a position to make demands on developers and if we don't like what they’re making, we certainly don't have to buy and play their games. This argument is the stronger of the two and can only be contradicted by challenging its underlying assumptions about what a video game is. Before doing that, however, the second point will be described, evaluated and challenged, as it is less internally consistent and is frequently undermined by counterexamples like <em>Nine Sols.</em></div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>This second argument is that the value and joy of difficult video games will go undiscovered for many people while easy modes are available. In this way, developers are justified and have a good reason for not including such modes or settings as a means of achieving their design goals and vision. But it goes a step further than the previous point to make some fundamental assumptions about human nature. That the only, or best way for people to come to understand the value of 'hard things' is by going through some form of compulsion. At the very least it holds these authoritarian strategies as valid and unproblematic, that an easy mode risks getting in the way of people learning these 'hard lessons', and that developers are entitled to impose these lessons, like an overbearing schoolteacher or parent, onto the player for their own good: 'so long as you're in my game you'll follow my rules'. It also assumes that people requesting or demanding easy modes must simply not understand how to play these games, that they have not given them the time, perhaps they lack mental resilience or motivation, that we shouldn't pander to people who can't 'step up' in this regard, etc.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>There is another way of presenting this argument, which instead frames it subjectively along these lines: 'I like playing games without an easy mode because its presence will change the context of my accomplishments in the game and the nature of the experience. While fighting a difficult boss the presence of an easy mode will distract me from the challenge of the fight'. For someone who claims to value the struggle and resolve necessary to complete difficult games, they aren't showing much of it here in relation to the allure of easy modes. This version of the argument seems to recognize the contradiction in the above's 'tough love' approach to instead turn the necessity of compulsion onto themselves.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Both versions of this second argument, in defence of the absence of easy modes, are demonstrably untrue. Every instance of a difficult game like <em>Nine Sols</em> maintaining its reputation as difficult, notwithstanding the presence of an easy mode, suggests that most gamers don't need to be forced into standard modes, especially when developers effectively communicate their intentions for the experience at the selection screen. This is so effective that people still criticize <em>Nine Sols</em> for being too hard, and apparently don't view story mode as an option for them against the standard experience. I am sympathetic to this and don't personally consider playing difficult role-playing games with any mode but the standard one. However, fighting games or shoot'em ups have the potential to be more difficult than any soulslike and for this reason, I will often use their difficulty settings and training features in the process of learning the game. These features are becoming more common and standardized, and far from castrating the experience, they actually serve to justify deeper, more complex and challenging systems in the game. Can you imagine a soulslike with difficulty settings and training modes? A lot would depend on how they are implemented but I can see them working well. Game mechanics would be unable to hide, and their mastery would be a more thoroughgoing decision on the player's part so that the game would not only be more accessible but could be more fully appreciated. This is, of course, provided it's found to possess enough substance to withstand being played from so many angles, in so many ways. It's like there is a fear among FromSoftware fans that these kinds of features would be abused, that we can't trust other players or even ourselves to not take the fun out of a game in the settings menu. But this hasn't happened to other genres.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Also, regarding instances of players farming for souls and cheesing bosses: the cheese itself is not what breaks the game, rather it is for a lack of tools and systems, a dearth of options for the discovery and learning of the game, which drives players to turn to cheese in the first place. Can we afford to empower players in the decision and discovery of what's fun and rewarding for them, or do developers already know the best way every player should play their game? Are developers supposed to make a watertight game that can't be taken advantage of, in a way that resists and fights the player? Or can a video game be more collaborative than that?</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Beyond the problematic assumptions about human behaviour being expressed in this second argument, we can identify certain prioritizations and value judgments being made around the actors which constitute the video game event. To say that an easy mode could prevent some people from receiving the developer's intended experience, maintains a distinction between developer and player, with clearly defined roles that make one subordinate to the other. It gives too much authority to developers in the context of the inter-human and dialogic event that is a video game. The interactivity of video games entails the emancipation of the image from its determination by a single party. This is not so naïve as to suggest that developers don't have control over the video games they produce. But for it to be a video game the final determination of the image, even if it is only the selection of one option over another, must be relinquished over to the player; the image is determined by players in the last instance, which is to say, video games are interactive. In every instance of a video game, the <em>intended</em> experience must yield to the real <em>lived</em> experience. This is actually true of all media in a sense, but the video game makes this explicit. It is a fundamental aspect, a condition of entry, which must be accepted by everyone involved in the production of the image, namely both developers and players. One cannot play a game without performatively accepting this, even if it is not expressly admitted.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>When a developer's 'intended experience' must always collapse into the actual lived experience of the video game, the issue, then, becomes one of communication rather than compulsion. The concept of compelling a player into an intended experience is mistaken and people will naturally resist it. The only thing preventing players from cheesing bosses, exploiting a game's systems or walking away, is what they have somehow been convinced to give to the developer. The game managed to communicate to them a certain way of performing the experience of this image — because it's fun, rewarding, they’re invested in the story, etc. There are simply too many other ways for a video game to convey its intended design for the method of excluding features to 'protect you from yourself' to have any merit. There are other reasons to do it, like, for example, a lack of resources in the case of an indie developer. However, companies like FromSoftware have no excuse and people's criticisms in this regard are legitimate. Not that I would contradict myself and propose some kind of compulsion onto them, but as fellow actors in these image-events, we are entitled to resist any determinations contradicting our intended experience.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>But are developers entitled to some extra authority on the grounds of artistic expression? This returns us to the first argument I described, which says that because gameplay constitutes an element of the art of video games, the video game, as an art form, should be given license to express itself in an unrestrained way, and shouldn't be held account to preferences or even accessibility needs of certain players.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Gamers can be very defensive of the art status of video games. We feel a need to legitimize the practice in relation to other media, like film, literature and music. It's necessary for the sake of recognition of creators and for the preservation of video games as cultural artifacts. On one level, arguing for video games as art is a very easy thing to do because the definition of art can be extremely broad; video games are a creative human expression through which we can explore new experiences, of course they're art.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>I don't intend to contradict that status here, but I will complicate it, make it not so straight forward an issue, to show you what such a status occludes. The first problem is that it sets us up to think about video games in the modes of other art forms, especially cinema. It leads some to place the video game on a sort of progressive trajectory along this line: theatre, cinema, video game, then maybe virtual reality. This means that the old concepts of previous mediums can still be applied to the video game, only the video game consists in the addition of a new feature: interactivity. Or there is another line the video game gets put in, where each medium can contain all the previous mediums inside it: a film can hold pictures inside it, but a video game can hold films. But this confuses a fundamental aspect of images generally to apply it to a progressivism. Images, whatever their type, have always been able to hold other images inside them into an infinite regress. The distinguishing feature of each art form entails a completely different orientation with the world, which gets discovered, often unexpectedly, and not invented through the application of new technology. There's an example of this in Deleuze's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> <em>Cinema 1,</em> where he describes how early cinema sought to replicate the theatre until it discovered, through a kind of naivety, the concept of the montage. Technology alone cannot give us a truly new art form, especially when it is directed towards enabling the reenactment of other mediums. One of the sad motivations for graphical improvements in video games relates to the video game's insecurity in relation to the cinema, its striving to achieve a cinematographic photo realism. But this all just gets in the way of the discovery and rediscovery of the video game proper, concepts which are its own, and which cannot be thought in the style of other art forms. The problem is not that video games are somehow undeserving of the cultural capital placed on cinema and the like, but that every argument for the art status of video games is not ambitious enough. 'Art' as it is now understood in the public discourse, is too small a concept for the video game and only serves to limit its discovery of itself.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>The idea of easy modes encroaching on the artistic expression of the developer limits video games. It limits them through an implicit unidirectional definition of art being imposed on gaming; gamers are spectators, and they receive the experiences developers, who are the artists, will give them. But what is the creative evolution we have so far discovered in the video game and what aspect of the experience can we attribute to it? It is the video game's ability to violate this very distinction between creator and consumer, and we call this feature of video games 'interactivity'. This is a radically new mode that is very distinct from other mediums. It's contributions to human experience are far from exhausted because it itself is not just a concept; it is a platform for the discovery of new concepts, but their source is not the developer. The source of these new concepts is the event happening between players and developers, which are interchangeable roles that can be mixed. That is the site of creativity and that is where we must point if we are interested in identifying and valuing video games as 'art'. Whether such a categorization is helpful to the video game event, if it helps us discover more of the video games possibilities, I am not sure. Easy modes, whatever their source, be it developers or mods, do not violate some creative intent because the creative event of a video game is the instance of it happening. If a particular video game happening right now is happening with an easy mode, so be it, that is what the video game is, it's still a creative event. We can be less concerned with determining and confining video games that have not happened yet.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>Regardless of how we choose to describe video games, it cannot be disputed that they do at least contain art in its more traditional forms. This is how Hideo Kojima <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(cited in Gibson <a href="#Gibson 2006" target="_blank" title="Gibson E (24 January 2006) 'Games aren’t art, says Kojima'">2006</a>)</span> thinks of his video games:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">Art is the stuff you find in the museum, whether it be a painting or a statue. What I’m doing, what videogame creators are doing, is running the museum - how do we light up things, where do we place things, how do we sell tickets? For better or worse, what I do, Hideo Kojima, myself, is run the museum and also create the art that’s displayed in the museum.</span></blockquote>
	<div>Video games without an easy mode leave a great deal of their art, the art which they contain, inaccessible to many people. Arguments against the necessity of easy modes for the preservation of artistic intent are only concerned with the art of the whole video game. They do this in a way that can prevent access to the separate instances of art contained in a video game. Should players have to miss out on <em>Nine Sols'</em> story because they are uninterested in its challenging combat? Video games are made out of art; the visual assets, design, animations, music and story should be enough to convince anyone of the cultural significance of video games. We do not need to make another argument on top of that for the artistic value of the whole, at least not in a deterministic way because there is still so much to discover in that regard.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>However, one thing we can say about the whole, putting art aside for a moment, is this: video games are software. Software has some very significant properties pertaining to human freedom, which ought to be preserved, against its commodification as a perceived discrete object. Consider what the Free Software Foundation </span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="#Free Software Foundation 2018" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018a) ‘Philosophy of the GNU project’">2018</a>:para.3)</span></blockquote> says about this on their website:</div>
		<blockquote><span class="small">Software differs from material objects — such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline — in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.</span></blockquote>
	<div>I'm not going to get into all the implications of this and will confine what I say to what is relevant to the topic of this essay. The issue of free software is not one of price but freedom. It's a freedom video games possess automatically, and which has been enjoyed by modding communities since the beginning. It's a freedom that can only be undermined through great effort on the developer's and publisher's part, to go against the video game's basic nature, to turn it into a one-way communication, more easily controlled, sold and reproduced on their terms. The concept of video games as art has unfortunately been mobilized to support larger systems of control. This is because companies, like Nintendo, will use that status to protect their intellectual properties, against the enjoyment of video games as software, as dynamic events that no sole actor can determine in the process of their distribution. To participate in a video game event, we purchase a video game, but what exactly have we bought? We ought to have purchased the determination of future instances of that event pertaining to us — I'm not advocating for piracy here — but if someone wants to mod their game to give it an easy mode it didn't already have, this is still a legitimate experience with the software. It might not be what the developers intended, but video games are always determined in the last instance by the player. The label of art should not be allowed to override the video game's more fundamental aspects as software. From the perspective of software development, of course, we are entitled to expect easy modes along with any other options we can think of to access the experience in the way we intend to.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>I need to set the limits of the application of what's been said here so it doesn't get over-extended. As has been already mentioned, there will be practical obstacles to including easy modes and accessibility options for many video games, especially those from indie developers and small studios. However, it is a healthy expectation for us to impose on the industry. This is not only for those individuals who depend on these settings for their enjoyment of, and access to, many video games and their art. Above, we've seen how easy modes accord with the video game's fundamental nature, as software and as a dialogic inter-human image-event. The thing that sets video games apart is that the user plays an essential role, in the determination of the image. This does not contradict the game developer's intended experience, which of course is still valued, but video games must contain multiple intentions that are not necessarily aligned. So, to limit the video game's determination on the basis of the creative authority of the developer is counter to the essence of gaming.</div>

	<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="2." class="eposition" href="" target="_blank" title="Video comming soon">&#9655</a></div>

	<div>At the time of writing this, I've not yet finished my playthrough of <em>Nine Sols,</em> but I'm approaching the final boss. I've had no inclination to adjust the difficulty away from the developer's intended experience, not for a sense of honour, pride or reverence for creative intentions, but for my agreement with what this video game has to say. Video games have things to say, ideas to posit and concepts to think, besides what can be said through words. <em>Nine Sols'</em> combat is designed around a parry mechanic, and each boss fight is a lesson in choreography around that system; its timings and the placement of talismans which are obtained by parrying. Adjusting the difficulty will strip a great deal of meaning from these systems. However, the standard mode will not be to everyone's taste, and I appreciate the story mode for its potential to enable the discovery of new concepts this game is capable of expressing, and for the access it gives to the many instances of art contained within. It is an example of the video game enjoying its right to a freedom that is absent in other media, for a video game is more than a simple authored object; it is an unresolved creative event we all get to be a part of.</div>
