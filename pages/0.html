<div>I call this document an image. It is an image on my monitor, as I write and manipulate it through software. It is an image for my reader — the image on your screen.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.02" class="position" href="m.html#000.02" title="This image evinces a dialogic software event.">000.02</a></div>

<div>This image is the by-product of a dialogue between myself and the developers of the various software I used to produce it, including <em>Microsoft Word</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Microsoft <a href="5.html#Microsoft 1983" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) Microsoft word [software]">1983</a>)</span>, <em>Scrivener</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Blout <a href="5.html#Blout 2007" target="_blank" title="Blout K (original author) (2007) Scrivener [software]">2007</a>)</span>, <em>Emacs</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Moon and Steele <a href="5.html#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>)</span>, <em>Adobe Dreamweaver</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Adobe <a href="5.html#Adobe 1997" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1997) Adobe dreamweaver [software]">1997</a>)</span>, <em>Obsidian</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Li and  Xu <a href="5.html#Li 2020" target="_blank" title="Li S and Xu E (original authors) (2020) Obsidian [software]">2020</a>)</span>, <em>Notepad++</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ho <a href="5.html#Ho 2003" target="_blank" title="Ho D (developer) (2003) Notepad++ [software]">2003</a>)</span> and finally <em>Sublime Text</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Skinner <a href="5.html#Skinner 2008" target="_blank" title="Skinner J (developer) (2008) Sublime Text [software]">2008</a>)</span>.

<div>It was even dialogic when I tried to write without using any software at all, which is how I wrote the first drafts of the sections about <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Funamizu et al. <a href="5.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="5.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="5.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span>.

I scanned those pages using the library’s scanner which sent them to my email. Here is an image of a page of that early draft:</div>

<div  aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.04" class="position" href="m.html#000.04" title="Notwithstanding, participate in this image digitally.">000.04</a></div>

<div>Because this essay is about digital images, and because it was produced as a digital image, it ought to be read as a digital image.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-1" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-1" aria-hidden="true"><sup>1</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-1"> The above instance about <em>Street Fighter</em> is not an exception to this because those efforts towards a non-digital procedure were designed to aide my understanding of my participation in this final digital image; it was a gesture towards, and all for the sake of, this digital image.</div></span> And though I appreciate the time my reader gives to <em>any</em> new instance of this image — I am grateful to be a part of any new image — I do have a preference. This preference stems from more than an author’s pedantic desire for consistency through topic and reader experience. The image I seek to fulfil here, with my reader, cannot transpire and cannot be experienced with a printed page. It can only be read and viewed and participated in, in the fullest sense, with a swiping thumb suspended over a smartphone or with a hand resting on a mouse. For, this image is interactive, as I will partially explain, after these four paragraphs about anthropology.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.05" class="position" href="m.html#000.05" title="Anthropology needs, yet is more than, ethnography.">000.05</a></div>

<div>Anthropology has always been more than ethnography. If ethnography looks like ‘establishing rapport, selecting informants, transcribing texts, taking genealogies, mapping fields, keeping a diary, and so on’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Geertz <a href="5.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span>, or if it is something less specific like Lévi–Strauss <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1962" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1962/2021) Wild thought: a new translation of la pensée sauvage">1955/2011</a>:17)</span> ‘proposing to tell the story of my expeditions’, these descriptions of ethnography do not capture what anthropology is. This is not to say ethnographic practice, some form of participant observation directed towards the human experience, is not an essential part of anthropology, only that anthropology does not end there. Anthropologists hold their discipline as an organon which encompasses ethnography; anthropology applies/employs ethnographic practice for theoretical, scientific or philosophical ends. Implicit in the articulation of an instance of anthropology is the assumption that <em>this</em> practice is <em>more</em> than mere ethnography, yet it cannot let ethnography go.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.06" class="position" href="m.html#000.06" title="Anthropology resists definitions.">000.06</a></div>

<div>How then to describe anthropology? Ethnography allows anthropology to resist definitions tied to any singular method or aspect. Geertz <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> did not want ethnographic practice to be mistaken for anthropology itself; he saw ‘these things, techniques and received procedures’ as insufficient for a <em>definition</em> of anthropology. More recently, beyond an ‘elaborate venture in... “thick description”’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Geertz <a href="5.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> we have further supplementals to the method, rounding out and complicating anthropology’s understanding of itself: ‘Anthropology...  is <em>philosophy with the people in</em>’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ingold <a href="5.html#Ingold Febrary 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (February 2014) 'Anthropology and philosophy or the problem of ontological symmetry’">2014</a>:para.1)</span>; ‘Anthropology [can be]... the theory/practice of the permanent decolonization of thought’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Viveiros de Castro <a href="5.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal metaphysics">2014</a>:40)</span>; ‘Anthropology is a venture in cultural transformation’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Pandian <a href="5.html#Pandian 2019" target="_blank" title="Pandian A (2019) A possible anthropology: methods for uneasy times">2019</a>:6)</span>, etc. But these are only local definitions designed to serve the author’s projects and together represent a lack of agreement. These authors want anthropology to be more than practice, more than mere ethnography.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.07" class="position" href="m.html#000.07" title="Anthropologies of diverse modes are all ethnographic (human) images.">000.07</a></div>

<div>They each give anthropology some philosophical (Ingold), theoretical (Viveiros de Castro), or political (Pandian) spin while preserving, or at least leaving room for, traditional modes of data collection; no one negates the practice of ethnography. When Pandian <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Pandian 2019" target="_blank" title="Pandian A (2019) A possible anthropology: methods for uneasy times">2019</a>:8)</span> frames anthropology as a means of ‘sustaining contrary ways of imagining and inhabiting the contemporary world’, he associates these features of the anthropological project with its methodological heritage and resists ‘disavowing this heritage altogether’. Ethnographic images of the master of the fishing spear’s live burial <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Lienhardt <a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:300)</span>, an Azande consultation with a poison oracle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Evans-Pritchard <a href="5.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>:127)</span>, a Ndembu circumcision rite <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Turner <a href="5.html#Turner 1967" target="_blank" title="Turner V (1967/1982) The forest of symbols: aspects of Ndembu Ritual">1967/1982</a>:151)</span>, etc., represent a by-product of the anthropological process still being generated today via/as images of Yukaghir hunting practices <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Willerslev <a href="5.html#Willerslev 2007" target="_blank" title="Willerslev R (2007) Soul hunters: hunting, animism, and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs">2007</a>)</span>, the process of exoplanet astronomy and place-making <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Messeri <a href="5.html#Messeri 2016" target="_blank" title="Messeri L (2016) Placing outer space: an earthly ethnography of other worlds">2016</a>)</span>, ‘expanding ethnography to reach beyond the human’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kohn <a href="5.html#Kohn 2013" target="_blank" title="Kohn E (2013) How forests think: toward an anthropology beyond the human">2013</a>:6)</span>, etc. These images of the human, their production, documentation, analysis, comparison, theorization, speculation and so on, are an essential element of what anthropologists do.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.08" class="position" href="m.html#000.08" title="Local definition: anthropology is an image generating technology.">000.08</a></div>

<div>This is how contemporary anthropology still finds itself valuing the ethnographic image and despite new definitions still regards itself as what I call an <em>image generating technology</em>. Though much anthropology would offer alternative descriptions of itself, this is an aspect of my local definition. It is a definition that will be further justified but anyone who does not accept this feature of anthropology will not accept the following thesis; they will not accept what videogames have to say here, about anthropology.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.09" class="position" href="m.html#000.09" title="Like anthropology, the videogame is an image generating technology.">000.09</a></div>

<div>The anthropologist interested in videogames has a different relationship to the phenomena which are to be represented, described and thought with, because the human event in question is already a multi-layered image. This fictional image of an enhanced human, Master Chief, aka John-117 (recipient of the SPARTAN-II augmentation procedures, 9 March 2525), killing Banished Unggoy Grunt and Kig-yar Jackal mercenaries with a plasma cannon (circa 28 May 2560), is a perfect reproduction of the image that transpired on my computer monitor 22 April 2022 (open and press play) <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo1()" id="btn1">OPEN</button>  
    <script>
        function toggleVideo1() {
            var video = document.getElementById('v1');
            var button = document.getElementById('btn1');
            if (video.style.display === 'none') {
                video.style.display = 'block';
                button.textContent = 'CLOSE';
            } else {
                video.style.display = 'none';
                button.textContent = 'OPEN';
            }
       }

</div><span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Staten et al. <a href="5.html#Staten 2021" target="_blank" title="Staten J, Crocker P and French T (directors) (2021) Halo infinite [videogame]">2021</a>)</span>. This image not only conveys the exact arrangement of pixels constituting the human image-event in question but delivers a representation of each of my decisions on 22 April 2022 and the culmination of the many prior decisions of the development team which contributed to that singular outcome. Here I am comparing the videogame’s capacity to generate human images to anthropology’s via ethnography. In defence of the latter, we could say that the videogame image leaves no room for ‘thick description’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Geertz <a href="5.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> because of the inherent coalescence of image and event in the medium; the event itself <em>is</em> an image leaving no thickness to describe, we already have all the data. Therefore, this competing practice of distorted representations of the human ought to be ignored criticised or separated from more compelling human assemblages like online virtual worlds, which can transpire in instances of online gaming but which ought to be separated from the videogame image itself.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.10" class="position" href="m.html#000.10" title="The videogame image can discover new modes of anthropology.">000.10</a></div>

<div>Contrarily, what follows is primarily concerned with the videogame image as a human event, its production and consumption, its inherent (non-)violence and creativity. This entails a different understanding of the videogame image than what I presented in the previous paragraph, which in turn opens up a different understanding of the anthropological image. Herein lies the real opportunity for anthropology (and videogames) in this forcing of the discipline to confront and do something with such an unnatural topic. Not only does the videogame image usher anthropological discourse towards new modes — beyond capturing more detail of the human experience we are pressed, in a style Deleuze and Guattari <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1991" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1991/2015) What is philosophy?">1991/2015</a>)</span> would welcome, to work <em>with</em> the phenomena to generate new concepts — not only does it contribute to Viveiros de Castro’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal metaphysics">2014</a>:40)</span> ‘decolonization of thought’ but a ‘democracy of thought’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle F (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:69)</span> because the anthropological ethnographic image and the data it rests on to qualify itself have no authority over the videogame image and both images are made equal participants in this new image. The videogame image, and as a consequence the anthropological image with it, are not instances of the human to be described but invitations to enter new human events, new images, of which this project is one. Another more simple but less implicative way to say this is, because the videogame image is already an image and because that image implies features unique to software (it is easily accessible and infinitely reproducible <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see <a href="b.html" target="blank">Free Software and GNU/Linux</a>)</span>) we are spurred to think in new ways, to find a way to contribute something more than the recording. That is, not necessarily to <em>thicken</em> the image, to anthropologise it and make it fulfil the needs of the anthropological discipline’s project, but to find new ways <em>into</em> the human image itself as something we perform, to reframe it as a new human event, to generate a <em>new</em> anthropological image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.11" class="position" href="m.html#000.11" title="Play the captured footage throughout.">000.11</a></div>

<div>Many of the pages that follow, like the present one, contain images and short videos, captured from the videogames being discussed. They should be played and/or viewed in the instances where they occur in the text. They are, in one limited sense, perfect portrayals of the events in question. The images and concepts conveyed in the text are suspended together in a way that is dialogic. This allows for something more to be present in the image and prose together, through a kind of relationality, which would otherwise be impossible.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="000.12" class="position" href="m.html#000.12" title="This participation constitutes a collaboration.">000.12</a></div>

<div>By playing each of the videos, this reader/user/viewer/player is producing an image which has not happened yet, collaboratively, with me. This is in the same way I produced the videos throughout, collaboratively with the developers of the videogames that are presented. And I have produced <em>this</em> image (as I said at the beginning) collaboratively with the developers of the software I used to write it.</div>
