<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a01" class="position" href="m.html#a01" title="FSF advocates for user rights.">a01</a></div>
			
<div>Since software has been distributed and sold as a finite commodity, the Free Software Foundation has fought to protect users’ rights in relation to it. Their ethical stance is connected to a more general construal of software which regards it as a special type of object. On their website, they explain:</div>
	<blockquote><span class="small">Software differs from material objects — such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline — in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program’s users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Free Software Foundation <a href="5.html#Free Software Foundation 2018a" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018a) ‘Philosophy of the GNU project’">2018a</a>:para.3)</span></blockquote>
<div>This understanding of software as a digital object is foundational to their human rights project, which is founded on utility. The user must be able to ‘take advantage’ of the properties that make software unique. Software is a thing to be manipulated, to have control over, and like any tool it must be ‘useful’. Anything less than complete access to and control over the source code, prevents instrumentation. Proprietary restrictions obstruct the user’s ability to make software an object for them, to penetrate it, comprehend it and change how it works. In a mechanistic understanding of the universe, every object can and ought to be understood and controlled, including software. Thus, ‘free software’ refers to user agency; it is, ‘…a matter of liberty, not price’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Free Software Foundation <a href="5.html#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) ‘What is free software?’">2018b</a>, para. 3)</span>. Such is the basis of the Free Software Foundation’s ethical and moral stance in relation to software. This stance both emerges from and motivates an intimate knowledge of software and a competence in its manipulation. Those responsible for the Free Software Foundation, particularly Richard Stallman, display these traits in the various achievements attached to the organisation. The most notable of these is <em>GNU/Linux</em>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a02" class="position" href="m.html#a02" title="GNU project creates a foundation.">a02</a></div>

<div>The <em>GNU</em> project started in 1983 with Stallman’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(1983 cited in Williams <a href="5.html#Williams 2010" target="_blank" title="Williams S (2010) Free as in freedom (2.0): Richard Stallman and the free software revolution">2010</a>:89)</span> announcement:
			
	<blockquote class="small">Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software called GNU (for Gnu’s not Unix), and give it away for free to everyone who can use it.</blockquote>
				
By 1991 Stallman and other contributors had developed and released much of a complete operating system (OS), apart from a working kernel <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Smith <a href="5.html#Smith 2012" target="_blank" title="Smith RW (2012) Linux essentials">2012</a>:8)</span>.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a03" class="position" href="m.html#a03" title="GNU/Linux is valued for utility and ethical freedom.">a03</a></div>

<div><em>GNU/Linux</em> has become the platform of choice for many users on two grounds, which converge. The first is utility. Many find <em>GNU/Linux</em>, and other software associated with it like <em>Emacs</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Moon and Steele <a href="5.html#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>)</span>, to be more powerful. There are seemingly infinite levels of customisation all the way down to the OS kernel, if one has the knowledge and ambition. GNU/Linux is the epitome of what Chun <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Chun 2008" target="_blank" title="—— (2008) ‘On Sourcery, or Code as Fetish’">2008</a>:300)</span> describes as ‘the valorization of the user as agent’. This connects to the second ground, namely ethics. Free software means ‘users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Free Software Foundation <a href="5.html#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) ‘What is free software?’">2018b</a>:para.3)</span>. All these become possible in <em>GNU/Linux</em> while in <em>Windows</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Microsoft <a href="5.html#Microsoft 1985" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) (1985) Windows [software]">1985</a>)</span> and <em>MacOS</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Apple <a href="5.html#Apple 2001" target="_blank" title="Apple (developer) (2001) macOS (software)">2001</a>)</span> often almost none of them are. Both grounds are tied to an epistemological stance, which I will trace to Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> and which places the good within a process of disengagement and control. Good productive humans are in control of their environment and of themselves. For this to be realised, one needs access to the bottom of things, i.e. the source code. It must be a possibility for the user to know everything constituting the object in question — to have these paths open is both good and practical.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a04" class="position" href="m.html#a04" title="Problematizing digital objects.">a04</a></div>

<div>Before continuing <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a>, I will problematize the notion of digital objects, as they are framed by the Free Software Foundation and the various projects attached to it, specifically <em>Arch Linux</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Polyak <a href="5.html#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>)</span> and a program designed for the <em>GNU</em> operating system called <em>Emacs</em>. This is to explore the paths which are closed to the human being in relation to software when it is regarded as an object as opposed to the event (what I have been associating with the videogame image). This interlude will, of course, have implications that extend beyond the <em>GNU</em> project, into the rest of this website and beyond. For, the treatment of digital objects is a widespread phenomenon. That it is conveniently and expressly stated in the Free Software Foundation’s rhetoric is one reason for my attention to it here. This is in the service of a broader discussion that needs to be had regarding software and the way it is researched.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a05" class="position" href="m.html#a05" title="Examining epistemological premises.">a05</a></div>

<div>The existence and value of digital objects are based on epistemological premises. Understanding what these premises are should be a precondition for any study into software and its relation to humans, but it is also essential to the more basic problem which is stating what software is in the first place. One cannot set out to describe a digital object without picking up a great deal of epistemological baggage — and I do not claim to be entirely immune to this either. One must conform to a particular way of knowing and the good to ask the question. This has been a neglected issue in the academic literature, not because the discourse on software materiality has almost been abandoned <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see McKeown <a href="5.html#McKeown 2018" target="_blank" title="McKeown C (2018) ‘Playing with materiality: an agential-realist reading of SethBling’s Super Maria World code-injection’">2018</a>:1235)</span>, but because the premises that make software coherent, regardless of its materiality, have gone unexplored. My goal here is to make a start on that process through a description of <em>GNU</em> software as an emerging inter-human event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a06" class="position" href="m.html#a06" title="GUIs contribute to perception of software.">a06</a></div>

<div>It is intuitive to attribute this construal of software – that is to regard it as a special type of object – as something inherent to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), stepping over the epistemological conditions that frame it entirely. That a list of commands can be made visible and graphically represented on a screen as a potentiality, the same way a sandwich sitting on the table is a potentiality contributes to how quickly most of us accept a description of the pictures on a monitor as ‘objects’. ‘These objects... can be made visible or invisible through the configuration of the system’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Hui <a href="5.html#Hui 2016" target="_blank" title="Hui Y (2016) On the existence of digital objects">2016</a>:1)</span>, popping in and out of existence as virtual lines or pathways. These paths are described and marketed to the user as physical objects, as metaphors, so they are immediately understood. The ‘desktop’ is where I arrange the items I am currently working on; the ‘file system’ is where my ‘documents’ are stored. And this is all a very natural and understandable way of describing how computers work, one that developers and programmers comply with and are largely responsible for, e.g. the founding <em>Unix</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Thompson et al. <a href="5.html#Thompson 1973" target="_blank" title="Thompson K, Ritchie D, Kernighan B, McIlroy D and Ossanna J (developers) (1973) Unix [software]">1973</a>)</span> idea that ‘everything is a file’ or object-oriented programming. Metaphors aside, if we were not so accustomed to GUIs it would be less obvious to describe a string of commands as a ‘digital object’.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a07" class="position" href="m.html#a07" title="GUIs simplify complex commands.">a07</a></div>

<div>Thus, the obvious explanation for the direction of OS development, as it has moved from the command line to the desktop environment or GUI, is that software has been made to resemble the way we already interact with physical objects. Computers have become visual because the way humans have evolved to interact with their environment is based on visual cues. It is easier for a person to deal with a complex list of commands if those commands are represented on a monitor as an icon with a name. This is to ‘hide a whole machine from its users’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kittler <a href="5.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>:para.12)</span> in a way that has become fundamental to how computers operate, and not even <em>GNU/Linux</em> has been able to escape this act of deception. For the software must be usable for the neophyte and this is accomplished through a GUI. When proprietary software does not close users off from parts of their machine, lack of knowledge and the sheer convenience of graphical interfaces will.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a08" class="position" href="m.html#a08" title="Digital objects necessitate metaphorical thinking.">a08</a></div>

<div>But all this only points to the type of object software is, ignoring what it means for software to be regarded as an object in the first place. We know there is something more behind the ‘images pulsing from the screen’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Chun <a href="5.html#Chun 2006" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2006) Control and freedom: power and paranoia in the age of fiber optics">2006</a>:4)</span>, for digital objects behave in a fundamentally different way to their physical counterparts. So, we have all gotten very used to thinking with metaphors. An object does not have to be physical to be ‘real’ and making this point in the context of computers has been one of Boellstorff’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>)</span> priorities. But there is an obviousness to this that makes it almost unnecessary. Things like money, as Boellstorff <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387)</span> notes or even the words I am writing now must be real in some sense. Kittler <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>)</span> was one of the few with a commitment to realism strong enough to reject this in his influential essay, ‘There is No Software’, but we need to move the discussion away from the realist/nominalist dilemmas. This is because regardless of where an author locates themselves on that spectrum, they always start from the digital object and make an attempt to grasp it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a09" class="position" href="m.html#a09" title="Digital objects present complex challenges.">a09</a></div>

<div>The digital object is a problem to be solved. For many researchers, ‘Software is, or should be, a notoriously difficult concept’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Chun <a href="5.html#Chun 2011" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2011) Programmed visions: software and memory">2011</a>:3)</span>. It is like the question of being, ‘For indeed we all know many beings, but what being itself is, or what it is to be, is an extremely obscure and intricate question’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Gilson <a href="5.html#Gilson 1948" target="_blank" title="Gilson É (1948/1961) Being and some philosophers">1948/1961</a>:7)</span>. This can be likened to the digital object and how it is often regarded. For it demonstrates and makes necessary a particular orientation towards the world which conditions the questions posed to it, albeit in a way that occludes its essence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a10" class="position" href="m.html#a10" title="Digital objects combine cultural forms and hidden complexity.">a10</a></div>

<div>For example, in many ways, software is the cultural object par excellence because it makes social constructivism tangible and obvious. The ‘meta-medium of the digital computer’ houses ‘cultural forms’ from which we can construct a genealogy of our time <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Manovich <a href="5.html#Manovich 2002" target="_blank" title="Manovich L (2002) The language of new media">2002</a>:6)</span>. But the digital object is also seen as something too strange for that, functioning ‘on a profound level of “sorcery”’ which remains hidden <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Chun <a href="5.html#Chun 2008" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2008) ‘On Sourcery, or Code as Fetish’">2008</a>:300)</span>. Regardless, whether software is revealed via ‘historical-cultural and technical narratives’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Frabetti <a href="5.html#Frabetti 2015" target="_blank" title="Frabetti F (2015) Software theory: a cultural and philosophical study">2015</a>:xix)</span> or is the manifestation of a ‘computational agency’ in ‘incomputable objects’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Parisi <a href="5.html#Parisi 2013" target="_blank" title="Parisi L (2013) Contagious architecture: computation">2013</a>:87,163)</span>, it is encountered as an object in the first instance and, for that reason, all these explanations move within a particular epistemological context. The problem of software, as an object, is only a problem within the theoretical space where software makes sense to us and where it is useable.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a11" class="position" href="m.html#a11" title="Software’s essence requires a novel entry point.">a11</a></div>

<div>Just as many philosophers have found being to be a problematic starting point — hence Heidegger’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heidegger 1927" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1927/2008) Being and time">1927/2008</a>:36)</span> indirect path via Dasein — software will never reveal itself without an external disruption. A novel entry point into the human event of software needs to be identified. Like being, software would then be a becoming that cannot be objectified or separated from ourselves without severing its essential parts. But this is not a step many have been able to embrace regarding software due to a preoccupation with the problem of the ‘digital object’ itself.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a12" class="position" href="m.html#a12" title="Anthropology focuses on software’s social function.">a12</a></div>

<div>The nature of anthropological investigations into software also demonstrates this. Anthropologists have generally failed to see software as an inter-human event, instead regarding it as a potential field-site, provided a platform meets certain criteria. As was mentioned above, we see this in the discipline’s focus on ‘virtual worlds’ as opposed to other digital phenomena. For example, Boellstorff <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>)</span> often differentiates virtual reality and software in general from ‘virtual worlds’, painting the latter as ‘persistent contexts of social immersion’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span>, ‘alternative realities’ with real social and political import. Boellstorff <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387)</span> insists upon virtual world’s social reality, and thus their value as topics of inquiry for anthropologists and social scientists. But this social reality hinges on how software is being used by humans as a distinct object; ‘a flight simulator run from a single computer not connected to the internet… is not a virtual world, because it disappears when the computer is turned off’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span>. Anthropology has no interest in software itself as a human event, only in its function as a social platform hence the strong focus on digital ethnographies <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Hine <a href="5.html#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>; Miller <a href="5.html#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>; Nardi <a href="5.html#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>)</span>. These ethnographies describe what software is doing to people, how it is changing human experience, sociality and expression. Again, the division here between the human and software is based on an understanding of the latter as an object to be understood, as a strange new location where the potentialities of the human are being reconfigured, e.g. ‘the social media landscape’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Miller <a href="5.html#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>:19)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a13" class="position" href="m.html#a13" title="Rethink software as human event, not discrete object.">a13</a></div>

<div>To problematize software’s treatment as a discrete object it cannot be our starting point. Such is the framework taken up in the above examples and the particularities of their various arguments have little bearing on the key issue, which lies in the abstraction of software in the first place. Deleuze and Guattari’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1991" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1991/2015) What is philosophy?">1991/2015</a>:21)</span> pursuit of the concept is a similar notion to the one I am making here: ‘The concept speaks the event, not the essence or thing… It is like the bird as event’. Likewise, we are moving towards a notion of software as human event, not as a thing with an essence that can be described. One means of doing this is to unmake software-the-object by showing it to be the product of certain epistemologies which also determine the grounds on which it has been examined. This context even informs our moral systems, understanding of the good and sense of self, which can not only be identified in the Free Software Foundation’s articulation of software and a person’s rights in relation to it, but even in academic spheres we see these forces at work as they frame the questions posed about software and how it is addressed. For, a great many unarticulated premises are involved in the gesture of treating software as a special kind of thing or problem in the first place.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a14" class="position" href="m.html#a14" title="Software engagement resembles classical realism.">a14</a></div>

<div>The way software is engaged with in the above examples moves like classical realism in how it starts from the object; the existence of a digital object is the presupposition and condition of engagement. But while starting from the digital object resembles and feels like classical realism in this sense, it is more fundamentally idealist. This is because the natural inhibitions all of us have towards realism, based on our experience with physical objects, work differently when applied to software. Kittler <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>)</span> was one of the few true realists in relation to software, when he reduced it to a ‘transformation of matter from entropy to information, from a million sleeping transistors into differences between electronic potentials’. But all this requires an unnatural way of thinking and abstraction atypical of realism.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a15" class="position" href="m.html#a15" title="Software as an elusive object defies instrumentation.">a15</a></div>

<div>This is because the digital object presupposes a Cartesian abstraction that has already taken place. To think like Kittler <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>)</span>, one has to work backwards to undo the epistemological context that is thrust into our minds every time we look at a computer screen. This is why software, as an object, always leads to further abstraction, a more fundamental abstraction has already happened for the object to exist at all. McKeown <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#McKeown 2018" target="_blank" title="McKeown C (2018) ‘Playing with materiality: an agential-realist reading of SethBling’s Super Maria World code-injection’">2018</a>:1239)</span> observed this in an exploration of code injection in Super Mario World:
<blockquote class="small">Greater Knowledge of ‘the game’ revealed that it was simply a series of instructions and activities that could be manipulated and distorted. Knowledge did not give rise to solidity but vaporiness.</blockquote>
Thus, software becomes an elusive and strange object that defies classical instrumentation aligning with the empiricist tradition. The experience of software, as a digital object, can only exist for an abstract self, a user, that is treated as separate from it. However, even a superficial understanding of the phenomenon reveals its dependence on a specific human condition. When it comes to software, we are all Cartesians.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a16" class="position" href="m.html#a16" title="Software is a human event.">a16</a></div>

<div>One response to this might be to question my specific association with Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> and the empiricist tradition he inspired. For example, this could be done with Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:349)</span> argument that ‘Science is not… a human construction. It is prior to intellect, independent of it, veritably the generator of Things’. Thus, digital phenomena are only imitating a process that is fundamental to the human condition and there is no reason to specifically associate it with Descartes. Software is the performance of a more general human phenomenon that takes place every time a person reflects on the nature of things and perception in a general sense. Dipping in and out of this kind of awareness is what it means to be in the world. When we are in a task, we do not perform this abstraction. When we experience movement, we make no attempt to grasp it, for doing so destroys it, but we all still know what movement is. Thus, abstraction is an element of human nature that is more basic than Descartes’ ideas, however broad their influence. Why can software not then be attributed to an instance of this basic human inclination? It should be – in the same way Descartes’ philosophy is an enactment of it too. But Descartes is still part of a broader trajectory we need to appreciate to understand software as a human event. It is the way perception and the body are being played with here, in the phenomenon in question, that is at issue. It is the prioritization of utility and radical reflexivity resulting in a specific kind of abstract self that needs to be identified in software. We can do this by unmaking the digital object through its association with Cartesian philosophy.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a17" class="position" href="m.html#a17" title="Software is an epistemological problem.">a17</a></div>

<div>Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> set the starting point within the intuition of thought and we have not left it. The creative evolution of software has been to give thought an object it can become, or, rather, it is thought’s or the self’s struggle to turn itself into an object. As was explained above, though starting from the digital object resembles realism, it is to follow Descartes exactly. For, Descartes ‘was in intention a realist’ and software is a continuation of that trajectory <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Gilson <a href="5.html#Gilson 1935" target="_blank" title="Gilson É (1935/2011) Methodical realism">1935/2011</a>:‘Methodical Realism’)</span>. Thus, software is an epistemological problem. It is not a mysterious thing to be understood but a way of knowing or stance the human has adopted towards the world. It is an instance of the human, a human event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a18" class="position" href="m.html#a18" title="Software parallels Descartes’ innovation.">a18</a></div>

<div>Software parallels Descartes’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> broader innovation to regard a process, namely the self, as an object. Descartes, the mathematician that he was, saw in those disciplines ‘which deal only with the very simplest and most general of things’, like arithmetic and geometry, that is, disciplines that can work with imagined objects, something beyond doubt. Though the wax is not perceived with the senses, in the ‘sweetness of the honey, or the fragrance of the flowers’ it is perceived nevertheless as ‘an inspection of the mind alone’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Descartes <a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span>. Then, everything becomes a question of process and one must no longer enquire into what a particular thing is, but the way it has been perceived by the mind. Descartes instigated a rationality that
	<blockquote><span class="small">...is no longer defined substantively, in terms of the order of being, but rather procedurally, in terms of the standards by which we construct orders in science and life.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156)</span></blockquote> 
Taylor draws a comparison between Plato’s model and Descartes’ innovation: ‘For Plato, to be rational we have to be right about the order of things. For Descartes rationality means thinking according to certain canons’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156)</span>. With Descartes, the issue is no longer turning oneself towards the correct good, but the process by which one finds the good. The process itself is brought into question.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a19" class="position" href="m.html#a19" title="Thought itself becomes an object to control.">a19</a></div>

<div>However, as Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> himself was keenly aware, it is not easy to consistently think in this way. Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:23)</span> reflects on how ‘a kind of laziness brings me back to what is more habitual in my life’, thus it is a process that must be seized and controlled:
<blockquote><span class="small">My mind likes to wander and is not yet willing to stay within the boundaries of the truth. Let it be and allow it once again to be completely unconstrained so that soon afterwards, when the constraints are reimposed, it will find it easier to be directed.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Descartes <a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:27)</span></blockquote>
Thought itself has become the object to control and understand. Software, then, as a beneficiary of Descartes’ model, can be viewed as both a demonstration of the objectification of the process that is thought, as well as a means of expressing and accomplishing that instrumentation.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a20" class="position" href="m.html#a20" title="Arch Linux demands user involvement.">a20</a></div>

<div><em>Arch Linux</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Polyak <a href="5.html#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>)</span> can demand a great deal from the user due to its involved installation process. This is an attractive feature for many because it allows for extensive customization while also serving as something of a rite of passage into the <em>Arch Linux</em> community. Every user on the <em>Arch Linux</em> subreddit has at least enough knowledge to have installed the operating system in the first place, which has led to a passionate and knowledgeable community. This installation process involves creating and formatting the necessary disk partitions, mounting the file system, installing packages and a bootloader, creating users and setting permissions. This must all be done manually in the terminal; there is no GUI with things to click on, the user must know what commands to type. Most people will eventually install a desktop environment or window manager to make using the computer easier, though there is a minority of users who prefer to remain in the terminal.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a21" class="position" href="m.html#a21" title="The installation of Arch Linux involves Cartesian abstraction.">a21</a></div>

<div>Every step along this process of installation involves a Cartesian instrumentation which depends on a radical reflexivity. Like doing a mathematical equation, constructing an environment of digital objects involves a retreat from the sensory world. It is true that creating and formatting disk partitions entails some physical change in the computer’s hardware, but it also involves a kind of objectification of thought. Users need to consider, at this very early stage, what they are planning to use the machine for: What thought events need to transpire in this conceptual space I am constructing? This will influence how large, for example, the swap partition should be because one needs a large swap for the computer to be able to go into hibernation. If this is not a priority, however, it could be a waste of space. These kinds of decisions are made throughout the whole installation process. Users need to choose what kind of file system they want to use, what the user privileges will be, what programs to install and finally what kind of desktop environment or window manager will best suit their needs. In short, they are creating a space for a special kind of mental labour that will take place, a labour that is entirely separate from the sensory world. Software is not the performance of pixels for our senses. That is only the conduit through which we gaze into a world of Cartesian detachment, which is premade and pre-abstracted. To build an OS is to map the terrain of that world, to plot out, in advance, the possibilities of thought. For, an OS exists to automatize the distribution of computer resources <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kothari et al. <a href="5.html#Kothari 2015" target="_blank" title="Kothari DP, Vasudevan SK and Subashri V (2015) Linux">2015</a>:1)</span>. That is, to make certain thoughts and events possible through the unprecedented ability to perpetuate the alterations of detached Cartesian thought. We make ourselves, our ideas, our metaphors and, in the case of <em>Arch Linux</em>, our operating systems. The self is being partitioned and its parameters are being drawn out in the creation of an OS, for the event of an isolated thinking self(selves) is what an operating system is.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a22" class="position" href="m.html#a22" title="User accounts separate users from the machine.">a22</a></div>

<div>This isolated self is an instance of radical reflexivity, for it is being separated, even from itself and becoming an object for itself. The building of an OS is a process of separation through abstraction; the user and machine are being teased apart through the automation of computer resource distribution. A culmination of this process of separation is the creation of a user account. Very few people use their computer solely in root because it is dangerous. One might accidentally delete or alter an essential file. Users need to be separated from sensitive files with passwords and individual log-ins. Even if only one person will ever use a computer, they still need an account with distinct permissions and changing how the computer works requires users to go into root or use ‘sudoers’. Thus, the human is an enemy to the complex functioning of a computer and a barrier of sorts needs to be constructed to preserve smooth operation. The GUI and user accounts are manifestations of this necessary separation. This is a performance of the separation Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> presents in <em>Meditations</em>, which results in a self that is distinct and separate from the entire sensory world.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a23" class="position" href="m.html#a23" title="Software constructs a cogito.">a23</a></div>

<div>In this way, the computer not only speaks to a user, it frames a cogito. Software cannot exist without it and all objects on screen are the event of the user participating in the process of making themselves and construing thought as an object. Software, as an event, is the process of framing a specific type of self. It both presupposes and enacts a cogito oriented towards utility. Writing code does not make software or digital objects but is a process of Cartesian abstraction, which for a user has already taken place.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a24" class="position" href="m.html#a24" title="Operating systems form distinct relationships with the machine.">a24</a></div>

<div>This generation of a sense of self is taking place any time we use a computer. <em>Arch Linux</em> is a useful example because in it we can see the intentional carving out of a self that the designing of an operating system entails. But this does not mean it applies any less to more popular operating systems like <em>Windows</em> or <em>MacOS</em>. The user boots up the machine as a user, skipping over some of the process of abstraction but there is still the initial instance of describing oneself, which establishes a distinct relationship with the computer. The user puts their name, region, language, privacy settings, etc., not to create some digital version of themselves, but to create a self, distinct from the machine, so that the machine can be instrumentalized, but also distinct from themselves so they can instrumentalize thought. It is a gesture of control, a gesture of instrumentalisation in the most radical sense. Even when there is no explicit user account, everything moving on the screen, the dialogue that is taking place, presupposes an individual orientated towards utility. This is true if the user is using a computer on the surface level or writing code to change how software performs. The colour of the icon is not in the icon itself but in the code, which can be controlled by an abstract self. This instrumentalisation is valued as an essential element of the self, which connects to self-expression, discipline and control. The premise of all software is the empowerment of the user as agent via a Cartesian objectification of thought.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a25" class="position" href="m.html#a25" title="Empowerment and control are central values in software ethics.">a25</a></div>

<div>There is conflict surrounding what constitutes empowerment, but empowerment itself, as a value, is never brought into question. The Free Software Foundation champions a very specific conception of user empowerment that hinges on the user’s unlimited access to the source code. But this is not a concern for most people, who would not know what to do with the source code if it were given to them. Indeed, for many users, too many options actually inhibit their freedom and they are left feeling disempowered. Regardless, there is a consensus surrounding an ethics that is centred on control. To deprive a human of that control is to withhold some fundamental right.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a26" class="position" href="m.html#a26" title="Arch Linux aligns with empiricist traditions.">a26</a></div>

<div>And here we can identify some of the sources of the <em>Arch Linux</em> rhetoric. For, while the wiki describes <em>Arch</em> as ‘a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Arch Linux <a href="5.html#Arch Linux 2021" target="_blank" title="Arch Linux (16 July 2021) Arch linux wiki">2021</a>:Pragmatism)</span>, the whole appeal of Arch, and GNU/Linux distributions like it, is that the user, to varying extents, builds or customizes it themselves. This aligns perfectly with the moral values often associated with empiricist traditions we associate with Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> and also Locke. For Locke <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(cited in Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:167)</span>, ‘The floating of other Mens Opinions in our brains makes us not a jot more knowing, though they happen to be true’, and there is likewise less value in a software when the user plays no role in its becoming. Just as the ideas of someone else do not really belong to me until I have gone through the necessary mental procedures to validate them for myself, a pragmatic approach to software should facilitate the user’s apprehension and control of software in the most fundamental way. This also aligns with the Free Software Foundation’s imperative, which is to enable users to use software rather than be used and controlled by it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a27" class="position" href="m.html#a27" title="Emacs embodies user empowerment.">a27</a></div>

<div><em>Emacs</em> is the epitome of Stallman’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Stallman 2019" target="_blank" title="Stallman R (2019) ‘Linux and the GNU system’">2019</a>)</span> vision of what free software that respects its users ought to be. Science fiction author, Neil Stephenson <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Stephenson 1999" target="_blank" title="Stephenson N (1999/2007) In the Beginning… Was the Command Line">1999/2007</a>:‘OS Shock’)</span>, describes it this way:
<blockquote class="small">I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor… the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text.</blockquote>
The prospective <em>Emacs</em> user should be forgiven for wondering what is lacking in this most basic of computer tasks. The average user does not meet a great deal of resistance when they set out to put words on the screen. <em>Emacs</em> will make this resistance a reality with a steep learning curve and with the promise of greater freedom on the other side. The program is well equipped to deal with writing complex bodies of text, for its main use is as a text editor for writing code. Much of this, as Stephenson and many other writers have found, translates well to the task of writing prose more generally. This is described as a process of learning how to use the software and this description turns on the notion of the good empowered human who is in control, who can seize an object and make what they want out of it, even when that object is themselves. That is, the user must make themselves in order to take control of the software. Learning how to use <em>Emacs</em> is a process of self-development.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a28" class="position" href="m.html#a28" title="Emacs demands a high level of competence.">a28</a></div>

<div>This will become clearer if we detail the typical movements that take place in <em>Emacs</em> as an emerging human event. <em>Emacs</em> is presented as a text editor designed for writing code, distinct for its customizability and extensibility. This is the appeal that might lead someone to participate in the evolving human event that is the software. Like all the <em>GNU</em> tools, <em>Emacs</em> represents an attempt to undermine the typical power structures inherent in software between developer and user. This is accomplished by demanding a great deal from the user. The software environment necessitates a high level of competence and to use <em>Emacs</em> effectively, the user must construct a workflow by editing config files, assigning and memorizing numerous key bindings and coming to terms with the design logic that has governed <em>Emacs’</em> development since its inception. This logic moves on the premise of expanding utility and explains why, at this stage, <em>Emacs</em> can be used to do almost anything from planning a project to surfing the internet or playing games. None of these possibilities, however, will be evident to the new user.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a29" class="position" href="m.html#a29" title="Learning and using Emacs transforms the user.">a29</a></div>

<div>If someone downloads the software with the intention of using it for creative or academic writing (as many do), they will likely feel profoundly confused and powerless when they first open the program. After seeing a page that says, ‘Welcome to GNU Emacs’, the user might be left wondering why there is no option to create a new document, or what a ‘buffer’ is. When they finally get a blank screen to type words on, they might feel a profound absence of customisation options and conclude the promised empowerment of <em>Emacs</em> is a lie. Eventually, they decide to read the manual, learn about major and minor modes, that for their purposes they need to switch to ‘org mode’ and start reading an entirely separate manual specific to that mode. Simple things that are normally taken for granted in a word processor, like the cursor automatically moving to a new line, might take an entire afternoon to resolve, especially if one is unpractised in stating the problem in the language of <em>Emacs</em>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a30" class="position" href="m.html#a30" title="Emacs is a process of self-development.">a30</a></div>

<div>The user is transformed through their participation in the event that is the software. Their comprehension and appreciation of the power of <em>Emacs</em> is proportional to their becoming with it, indeed this should be regarded as an arbitrary distinction. <em>Emacs</em> is an act of framing a particular kind of Lockian self that is disciplined and self-developed. I say it is Lockian because of the way Locke <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Locke 1689" target="_blank" title="Locke J (1689/2001) An Essay Concerning Human Understanding">1689/2001</a>)</span> pushed Descartes’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> disengagement further to the point of self-remaking. For Locke <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(cited in Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:170)</span>, the will is entirely determined by an ‘uneasiness of desire’. That is, our actions are reactions to the greatest discomfort and educating ourselves according to correct cannons can ‘change our pleasures, and give us a relish to what is necessary’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Locke cited in Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:171)</span>. There are necessary growing pains associated with learning <em>Emacs</em>, but the user will eventually come to enjoy and value these initial inconveniences as essential. The user comes to appreciate the utility of <em>Emacs</em>. It is not just about learning how to use the software but learning to want to do what is possible with it. In this way, software is a preestablished map for the possibilities of thought. Coming to terms with those possibilities entails the making of a new self, one that can more fully participate in the inter-human event that is the software.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a31" class="position" href="m.html#a31" title="Emacs and Arch Linux aim to liberate users.">a31</a></div>

<div><em>Emacs</em> and <em>Arch Linux</em> are expressions of an ambition to liberate the user via software. The continuing event of their becoming moves within an explicit rhetoric that construes software as a special kind of object that the human can use and control. My construal of them as events, linking them to and bringing into question a Cartesian epistemological context, is a reaction to that rhetoric.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a32" class="position" href="m.html#a32" title="The development and use of software are shared events.">a32</a></div>

<div>I regard software to be an anthropological issue, for it is a shared becoming and evolution of the potentialities and possibilities of the human. No single person is the author of <em>Emacs</em> or <em>Arch Linux</em>. All the contributors are also users. The melting away of the distinction between developer and consumer is another reason I have chosen to focus on software associated with the Free Software Foundation. Proprietary software only adds another layer to prevent us from realising software in general to be an enactment of epistemological and moral ideas. But now that we have shown free software to be a human event, it necessarily follows that all software is. The further implications of the consumerist and capitalist contexts of both free and non-free software will need to be picked up elsewhere.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a33" class="position" href="m.html#a33" title="To gain new interpretations of software.">a33</a></div>

<div>What I find more pressing however, is the need to move our discussion beyond the historical sources of ideas that have been identified here. It is one thing to uproot the Cartesian sources of the broad human phenomenon that is software, as they pertain to unarticulated epistemological and moral stances, but this reading must then be used to gain leverage for a new and creative interpretation of the same. If we allow this analysis to rest on a historical or genealogical explanation, then we have made even less progress than those whose central focus is the digital object. Software will have been reduced to a simple enactment of enlightenment ideas, taken to their extreme, occluding the creative and evolving event that it is. Cartesian abstraction and Lockian self-making were only able to be identified from without, via a rejection of the digital object as a premise. This identification has served to further open the possibilities of thought towards software as an inter-human event and, as such an event, software manifests internal defiances to these models, which can now be thrown into relief.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="a34" class="position" href="m.html#a34" title="Software objectifies and asserts the self.">a34</a></div>

<div>We have seen that software not only generates an abstract self but apprehends and plays with the irreconcilability of the mind-body problem. The self is both objectified and asserted simultaneously as we engage with the apparatus. It is both captured and liberated via a seizure of perception enabled by the GUI. We give ourselves to the spectacle of the machine and are at the same time apprehended by it in ways that have not yet been fully appreciated. A rasterized digital object spins before my eyes and though I contemplate the pixels, refreshing display or electronic circuitry of the central processing unit, making hundreds of millions of calculations per second to produce the illusion of an object based on mathematical equations – the object is there, it has taken my body, and I cannot help but behold it.</div>
