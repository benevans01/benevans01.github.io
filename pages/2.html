<h1 align="center" id="2">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL</h1>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="049" class="position" href="m.html#049" title="We use cinema to start thinking about videogames.">049</a></div>

<div>It is easy to approach the videogame image via the cinema, at least as a first step. This is because thinking with videogames through concepts owed to cinema entails language and ideas that are familiar to us. Though Galloway’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2)</span> definition of videogames draws a clear distinction between the two mediums — ‘If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video games are actions’ — he still relies on cinematographic language and gestures to explore what videogames are doing. For example, the first-person shooter is described as a POV shot, and Italian neorealism is evoked to urge videogames towards a social realism, focused on ‘narrative, not representation’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Galloway <a href="5.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:39,75,80)</span>. When Atkins <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Atkins 2003" target="_blank" title="Atkins B (2003) More than a game: the computer game as fictional form">2003</a>:24)</span> imagines some future day when ‘…perhaps, the computer game will even produce its À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or its Ulysses, its Casablanca or its Citizen Kane’, it is easy to see his point. When will the videogame produce, and (perhaps more importantly) be recognised for, the kind of penetrating reflections on life and the human condition commonly celebrated in the classics of literature and cinema? And this question assumes such classics will surely reveal themselves in time, for the videogame is assumed to be on a similar trajectory to other mediums born out of older technologies, most recently cinema.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="050" class="position" href="m.html#050" title="The videogame can be seen as an interactive film.">050</a></div>
<!--link-->
<div>And it is easy to regard many videogames as a kind of interactive film, especially when they are so often designed and presented in cinematic ways. Motion capture is now a stage of development many films and videogames share: the capturing and reproduction of movement for the sake of an image it has not yet become. Computer-generated images are not an essential part of videogames or films, but both have embraced that style of image-making. There is a clear difference in application. Videogames usually need the image of gameplay to be one continuous shot, so motion capture is reserved for those instances where videogames express what is unique about them the least: the cutscene. An exception could be interactive cutscenes, like the dance battle in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nomura et al. <a href="5.html#Nomura 2020" target="_blank" title="Nomura T, Hamaguchi N and Toriyama M (directors) (2020) Final fantasy vii remake [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> or the torture scene in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Druckmann et al. <a href="5.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. These are pulling the functions of the original cutscene, where videogames resemble film, into the realm of interactivity. These instances, especially when they are taken outside the broader context of the videogames they are a part of, can feel and look like watching a film that demands occasional button presses, to be sure we are paying attention.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="051" class="position" href="m.html#051" title="The 3D world was introduced as a diegetic POV shot.">051</a></div>

<div>Interactive or otherwise, cutscenes have been a part of videogames since we started traversing 3D worlds, at least since <em>Super Mario 64</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Miyamoto <a href="5.html#Miyamoto 1996" target="_blank" title="Miyamoto S (director) (1996) Super Mario 64 [videogame]">1996</a>)</span>. There, we see the visuals of gameplay itself presenting a greater conceptual hurdle in the minds of developers and players than the game’s cutscenes. The opening cutscene attempts to provide a diegetic explanation for the new cinematic element of gameplay, namely an adjustable camera following the controllable character. It opens with a sweeping aerial shot of Peach’s castle, following one of the Lakitu Bros. — a turtle-like creature, floating on a cloud, holding a fishing rod with a camera attached to it. We see a pipe come out of the ground and the Lakitu Bro. circles around. It then cuts to a POV shot of the pipe from the Lakitu Bro.’s camera’s perspective, <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo8()" id="btn8">OPEN</button>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="052" class="position" href="m.html#052" title="The cinema metamorphosing into a question.">052</a></div>

<div>This was demonstrated to us in the first instance via the language of cinema, a language we already understood. What we see in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has become the standard transition from cutscene to gameplay. The over-the-shoulder-shot pulls us into the image, it hands us the reigns or, more accurately, poses to the viewer a question and by answering that question the viewer becomes a player. We have come to expect this kind of shot, this transition where cinema is metamorphosing into a videogame. It is worth noting how <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nomura et al. <a href="5.html#Nomura 2020" target="_blank" title="Nomura T, Hamaguchi N and Toriyama M (directors) (2020) Final fantasy vii remake [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> plays with that expectation in its opening cutscene. We are eager to take control, and the camera teases us by first settling behind Biggs and then Barret before finally orienting us in relation to the game’s protagonist, Cloud. <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo9()" id="btn9">OPEN</button>

Here, the cinema here is moving on the videogame’s terms, it cannot escape asking the question and in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> we see a creative evolution of how it is being asked.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="053" class="position" href="m.html#053" title="Is the videogame concealed as cinema?">053</a></div>

<div>Does this demonstrate how strongly cinema has framed our comprehension of new media or the immaturity of the videogame as a medium itself? A medium’s immaturity is what Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:3)</span> identified in early cinema, for</div>

	<blockquote class="small">…things and people are always forced to conceal themselves, have to conceal themselves when they begin. What else could they do? They come into being within a set which no longer includes them and, in order not to be rejected have to project the characteristics which they retain in common with the set.</blockquote>

<div>Thus, just as cinema only commenced as an imitation of natural perception before later evolving into the movement-image, <em>Super Mario 64</em> had to present itself as an interactive cinema, not only because that is what was understandable to us but because that is what the videogame understood itself to have become.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="054" class="position" href="m.html#054" title="Videogames strive for the cinematic image.">054</a></div>

<div>But this association with cinema does not work in every respect. One major difference is that, in many ways, the videogame’s resemblance to cinema does not describe the medium’s genesis but one of its strivings. There were certainly 2D videogames before there were 3D ones. And while the medium commenced with the manipulation of symbols and shapes in the forms of <em>Pong</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Alcorn <a href="5.html#Alcorn 1972" target="_blank" title="Alcorn A (designer) (1972) Pong [videogame]">1972</a>)</span> and <em>Pac-Man</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Iwatani and Ishimura <a href="5.html#Iwatani 1980" target="_blank" title="Iwatana T and Ishimura S (designers) (1980) Pac-Man [videogame]">1980</a>; see Rodgers <a href="5.html#Rodgers 2020" target="_blank" title="Rodgers T (23 November 2020) 'Action button reviews Pac-Man' [video]">2020</a>:3’10”)</span>, the pursuit of the spectacle of photo-realism has led the videogame to resemble the movement-image of cinema more closely. Regardless of what we classify to be the first true videogame, and it is not Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>)</span> style (and especially not Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span>, as we will see) to draw clear distinctions like that anyway, the cinematic videogame was an event for the medium. It was the beginning of a new form of encountering and participating in images — the event of the videogame image had become something new.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="055" class="position" href="m.html#055" title="The videogame discovers new applications of the cinematographic illusion.">055</a></div>

<div>Videogames did not evolve out of cinema, but the illusions of movement in videogames have been developed with the cinema in mind. Cinema, while absent from most definitions of, or origin stories for, the medium of videogames, has been a constant reference for the medium’s application of the cinematographic illusion, especially once games became 3D. But none of this has barred the videogame event, its performance as an image, from its own creative evolution. For, the cinematographic illusion has still been made to serve and probed according to a new style. What could have once been described as a movement-image, has now been forced to change, fundamentally, in adopting the context of a videogame, notwithstanding remnant resemblances of the form that inspired it. A brief description of that cinematographic form will be necessary for what follows.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="056" class="position" href="m.html#056" title="Cinema generates real movement by mobilising sets.">056</a></div>

<div>According to Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span>, cinema gives us real movement. That is, from the illusion of movement created by a series of still frames presented rapidly and at equal distance from each other, movement is ‘extracted from itself’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span>. From the illusion, cinema extracts ‘real movement’, not by adding movement to a still image, imitating natural perception, but via the mobilisation of a set. This mobilisation is accomplished through the movement of the camera and through cinematographic techniques like montage <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:25)</span>. The set of frames that originally formed a cinematographic illusion, is mobilised through a breach of the limitations of the subject. The camera moves freely and instantly through space and time and in this way generates real movement.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="057" class="position" href="m.html#057" title="Real Bergsonian movement will be explained.">057</a></div>

<div>But it will not become clear exactly why or how this transcendence of subject and object constitutes real movement until the Bergsonian picture of movement Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>)</span> had in mind is clarified. Real movement, for Bergson <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>)</span>, is infinite in two complementary ways which nullify the movement from, and the distinction between, a subject and object.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="058" class="position" href="m.html#058" title="For Bergson, real movement is absolutely indivisible.">058</a></div>

<div>Real movement is absolutely indivisible <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:246-253, <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-200)</span>. When measuring a trajectory, we consider the changes in distance between two or more objects over time. The line imagined between the objects, which is divided into sections and used as a reference to describe the movement, does not convey the whole movement itself <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:246)</span>. The line can be divided an infinite number of times, as shown in Zeno’s paradox <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Aristotle <a href="5.html#Aristotle 1999" target="_blank" title="Aristotle (1999) Physics">1999</a>:143)</span></span>,  but then we are only dividing ‘the line supposed to have been traversed, and not the movement traversing it’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:246)</span>. The whole movement is already given instantly by our perception. Concrete parameters cannot be drawn around movement itself, only the divisible path we imagine to retrospectively describe it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="059" class="position" href="m.html#059" title="For Bergson, real movement is absolutely relative.">059</a></div>

<div>Real movement is absolutely relative <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:254-255,267)</span>. In physics, movement can be considered a universal phenomenon of the acentred whole <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:254)</span>. Everything is moving in relation to everything else on both a macro and a micro scale. Descriptions of these movements can only be extracted once a point of reference or centre is selected and a line is drawn between the points. But these details will only describe a change over time within those finite parameters. Real movement is relative to an infinite number of points in addition to our bodies. Thus, movements are acentred vibrations encompassing the entire universe.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="060" class="position" href="m.html#060" title="Real movement dissolves subject and object.">060</a></div>

<div>Bergson <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>)</span> rejected distinctions between the subject and the object in the same way. The body is not immune to the above critique of parameters and limits; there is no absolute threshold separating it from other objects grouped together to understand the world; ‘the visual perception of an object, the brain, nerves, retina and the object itself form a connected whole’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:285)</span>. Perception, as a movement, cannot be divided into sections and still retain the whole that is immediately given, as would be necessary to distinguish subject and object. Neither can one’s body be placed at the centre of all movements in the universe without losing the image of the whole movement <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:260)</span>. In this way, pure subjectivity and individual identity are turned away from real movement.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="061" class="position" href="m.html#061" title="Cinema transcends dualism through (real) acentred movements.">061</a></div>

<div>Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>)</span> used these same Bergsonian arguments against dualism to describe the cinema. In Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>, <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> description of movement, there is always another division to be made, another body in space from which to measure the trajectory’s relative position and another position itself, constantly emerging. In cinema, Deleuze saw that there was always another shot, always another frame that is different from the one before it as an acentred movement through space and time. Thus, through montage, by virtue of the movement becoming acentred, cinema comes closer to real movement than natural perception. The essence of the cinema is to transcend the subject and the object through acentred movements.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="062" class="position" href="m.html#062" title="The cinema discovered and mobilised its sections to generate new images.">062</a></div>

<div>At least, this is one way of describing the creative evolution that has taken place: the cinema’s gradual discovery of the mobilisation of its sections in pursuit of the new. This is what Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:141-177; <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> charts in <em>Cinema 1</em> and <em>Cinema 2</em>, from the centred action-image where everything is confined to react to the centre of a set, to the acentred time-image, where a linear narrative is abandoned to mobilise the image further. Cinema does not give us an illusion of movement through immobile sections, it mobilises sections through qualitative change or the production of the new <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:9)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="063" class="position" href="m.html#063" title="The movement-image (real movement) is absent from early cinema.">063</a></div>

<div>Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> asks, ‘What happened when the camera was fixed?’, leading to a description of ‘a primitive state of the cinema where the image is in movement rather than being a movement-image’. This is how the early cinema, its essence not yet realised, imitated the mediums that preceded it like theatre, photography or natural perception <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:25)</span>. The idea of montage had not yet emerged, so in this early version of the medium, ‘there is therefore no communication of mutually referring variable sets’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span>. Shots were stationary and the movements within were spatially determined <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:3,24)</span>. Movement was therefore localised to the things themselves. This is how, like scientific representations of movement, the cinematographic illusion amounts to points on a line over time <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span>. This absolute centre, around which the characters and objects are referenced, means relativity is also absent. While the movement-image’s genesis cannot be truly identified, for the same reason a point on a trajectory is only a convenience and can always be made more precise, we can at least say that early cinema did not yet provide what Deleuze calls a movement-image.</div>

This demonstrates a tension in videogame design between a desire to move towards what is appealing in a cinematographic language and the parameters necessary to make gameplay clear, intelligible, and fair for players.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="065" class="position" href="m.html#065" title="Videogames, like early cinema, lack a movement-image and by extension ‘real movement’.">065</a></div>

<div>Thus, videogames mark an involuntary return, in a sense, to the static camera of early cinema to clarify its gameplay elements. Restricting camera movement also restricts the key innovations of early cinema that led to the movement-image. There is, therefore, something fundamental in the gesture of videogames running counter to Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:337; <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> descriptions of real movement.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="066" class="position" href="m.html#066" title="Cutscenes are tied to player agency while cinema interrupts it.">066</a></div>
 <!---link no.--->		
<div id="2.4p4">Again, cutscenes might be described as an exception when the camera ceases to provide a single continuous shot. But even if we follow Keogh’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:118)</span> argument and include cutscenes as part of the videogame event, cutscenes still depend on gameplay for the role they play in a videogame. As we saw at <a title="‘And it is easy to regard many videogames as a kind of interactive film...’" target="_blank" href="#050">050</a>, cutscenes represent what is most analytically familiar to us and what is easiest to articulate in the phenomenon. However, this is not to suggest cutscenes and cinema are the same thing or have the same effect on the player. In the case of a cutscene, one’s orientation towards the image is completely different. Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="5.html#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="5.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.)</span> game and feel like they were watching a movie, but the player would have a different experience. That difference emerges out of the cutscene’s proximity to gameplay for the player. During gameplay the camera is tied to a single point, like the playable character or arena, to facilitate player agency. That context precedes any Deleuzian images we could identify in the cutscene as a text. That history of agency frames what the cutscene means and what it is accomplishing. For, the production of a new videogame image is the result of player agency within the image-event. In contrast, the technique of montage is an interruption, a removal of agency. Compared to a videogame, a film has already happened. I had not finished taking in the futuristic depictions of Los Angeles in <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Villeneuve <a href="5.html#Villeneuve 2017" target="_blank" title="Villeneuve D (director) (2017) Blade runner 2049 [motion picture]">2017</a>)</span>, but the story kept moving regardless. A videogame must give us time to act, in a way that is finite or in a way that is unrestricted like a novel or comics, if it is to be, as Galloway <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2)</span> says, an ‘action’. And unlike other mediums, the videogame can also provide space, in addition to time, as another plane on which agency can be applied. One cost of this is the tethering of the camera, or point of view, to one’s decisions.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="067" class="position" href="m.html#067" title="Contra Deleuze’s cinema, Street Fighter performs illusions of movement.">067</a></div>

<div>We can see this most clearly in 2D fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Funamizu et al. <a href="5.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="5.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="5.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span> where there are no changing perspectives, not even via the direction of a Lakitu Bro., and the camera is static, save some automatic adjustments along a two-dimensional plane to keep both players in view. Centred illusions of movement give us a single shot that is a side-on view of both players’ characters. Thus, while Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>)</span> was able to redeem cinema from Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-195)</span> critique of the cinematographic illusion through a description of cinema’s acentred movements, in <em>Street Fighter</em> the critique finds a new home. The character animations in <em>Street Fighter</em>, like early cinema, only imitate movement with a series of still frames and the by-product is an illusion and does not, according to Deleuze’s descriptions of cinema, constitute real movement. <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo11()" id="btn11">OPEN</button>

<div>Finishing moves are a brief exception to this in the franchise’s recent instalments.

The insertion of cinematographic techniques here is used to communicate the strategic value of the move and elevate the spectacle and drama of a fight.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="069" class="position" href="m.html#069" title="Street Fighter limits space and time for player agency.">069</a></div>

<div>We can see in <em>Street Fighter</em> that this apprehension of the camera does place a kind of limit on space and time as a result of having given them to the player. In cinema, the viewer has no control over these ‘forms of intuition’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kant <a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:B305)</span> presented (performed) in the image, but the camera relishes in their manipulation. <em>Street Fighter</em> only exists within a set of tight parameters, an idea obviously counter to Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> descriptions of real movement. The actions available to the player are limited; there are three punch buttons, three kick buttons and a directional pad or stick to move the player’s avatar left and right, to crouch and jump. A border encloses the animations, and nothing exists outside it. The available illusions of movement create a finite illusion of space. After a match, the illusion of space and time is destroyed, for, available contributing actions are zero and the successive equidistant frames have ceased. In this way, the parameters of <em>Street Fighter</em>, as a video<em>game</em> ‘circumscribed within limits of space and time’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Caillois <a href="5.html#Caillois 1961" target="_blank" title="Caillois R (1961/2001) Man, play, and games">1961/2001</a>:9)</span>, come from the limits placed on the illusions of movement in-game. The animations or illusions of movement as actions chosen by the player, not movement-images, are foundational to the entire experience of <em>Street Fighter</em>. The player has extended a part of themselves into the event of the image or cinematographic illusion as it is being produced and some limitations are necessary for that to occur; developers give players a finite set of possibilities.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="070" class="position" href="m.html#070" title="The videogame image is a collaboration within parameters.">070</a></div>

<div>This is how the human participates in the production of a videogame image, i.e. the event of image production in dialogic collaboration with a developer who has established parameters to create a space for player agency. This problematic emerged for us, and we are so far coming to terms with it, in the same way we came to terms with the fixed camera following Mario in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. That is, via the concepts of, and in contrast to, the cinema.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="071" class="position" href="m.html#071" title="Definitions can limit our engagement with videogames as a new mode.">071</a></div>

<div>The description of videogames in this way, as a human event evolving with and against other human events, namely cinema, is counter to agendas that seek to define what a videogame is. Rough <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rough 2018" target="_blank" title="Rough B (2018) ‘Videogames as neither video nor games: a negative ontology’">2018</a>:33)</span>, in his definition, gives some examples of videogames without any visual component at all, like ‘videogames for the visually impaired’, to prove that video or images are non-essential to the phenomenon. But the character animations <em>are</em> an essential part of <em>Street Fighter</em> and autonomy over them is how we experience the game. This is not to use <em>Street Fighter</em> to say something general that can be applied to all videogames. Rather, <em>Street Fighter</em> reveals something the videogame is doing with the cinematographic illusion. This speaks to the possibilities of human experience in relation to videogames as a dialogic and evolving event. As an event, rigid definitions of the videogame prevent us from following along with it.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-1" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-1" aria-hidden="true"><sup>1</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-1"> Though I persistently combine the words ‘video’ and ‘game’ to encourage an understanding of the videogame as its own seperate phenomenon and not a combination of the two, in the situation of the present paragraph we could say ‘<em>video-game</em>’ in the same way Wittgenstein <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Wittgenstein 1953" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1953/2009) <em>Philosophical investigations</em>">1953/2009</a>:22)</span> employs the term, ‘<em>language-game</em>’.

<div>At <a title="‘Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima game and feel like they were watching a movie...’" target="_blank" href="#066">066</a> I mentioned the possibility of regarding a typical Kojima <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="5.html#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="5.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.)</span> game as a film and it is possible to do this with any videogame. Videogames have the potential to contain films within them – a movie could be playing on a TV screen in the gameworld, a cutscene can be taken out of context, player autonomy can be ignored and we can pretend that gameplay is just another shot of a film. Some have taken this to mean the videogame, and those ambitions attached to it like VR, represent the next evolutionary step in visual media through a lens of progressivism. Our own Kojima <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(cited in Gibson <a href="5.html#Gibson 2006" target="_blank" title="Gibson E (24 January 2006) 'Games aren’t art, says Kojima'">2006</a>)</span> famously gave license to this line of thought when he said,</div>

	<blockquote class="small">…Art is the stuff you find in the museum, whether it be a painting or a statue. What I’m doing, what videogame creators are doing, is running the museum - how do we light up things, where do we place things, how do we sell tickets? For better or worse, what I do, Hideo Kojima, myself, is run the museum and also create the art that’s displayed in the museum.</blockquote>

<div>But here, Kojima is describing an inherent quality of images generally. Everyone who sees the painting, <em>Whistler’s Mother</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Whistler <a href="5.html#Whistler 1871" target="_blank" title="Whistler JM (1871) Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 [painting]">1871</a>)</span>, notices the painting within a painting, hanging on the wall. It has always been possible to contain images within other images, leading to new contexts and experiences in relation to the image. While videogames certainly entail new ways of encountering images, we must not forget that Kojima’s museum is, itself, an image. This is not a feature that makes videogames a unique human experience, neither is it why they are interesting. Even generous definitions like Kojima’s are unhelpful here.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="073" class="position" href="m.html#073" title="Mathematical infinity in videogames performs an enclosure of being.">073</a></div>

<div>We can make a critique of Kojima’s definition of the videogame which resembles Žižek’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>:200)</span> description of cyberspace, regarding the ‘unbearable closure of being’. Unlike an actual museum, the gameworld is inevitably closed, there is a finitude in how the experience is contained and does not overflow us. Of course, a videogame can be infinite in a mathematical sense, in a sense convenient to the computer. But Žižek’s point is that this type of infinity is exactly what leads to the closure, a phenomenon revealing all its parts indefinitely with nothing that is, in principle, inaccessible. A randomly generated world might extend forever while at the same time concealing very little. In videogames, while we regard them in this way, we do not need to wonder; we do not need an excess.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="074" class="position" href="m.html#074" title="Videogames are distinct for orienting us towards the Real.">074</a></div>

<div>Now, if there is something that distinguishes the various image mediums like painting, photography, cinema or videogames, it is not that each one represents a higher order, like the idea that each new medium contains all the previous ones within it. It is that each medium entails a new way of using images to orientate us towards the real, towards something irreducible and open. In the case of videogames specifically it is towards the image itself as immanent lived experience, towards the image as an irreducible event. Hence, this project is interested in videogames for the way they orient us in relation to the event of the image, which is to move beyond the perception of the videogame image being a collection of calculated and pre-planned frames, and beyond the videogame image as a limited version of Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>)</span> movement-image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="075" class="position" href="m.html#075" title="A paintings borders enable our contribution, making the event irreducible.">075</a></div>

<div> Compared to other mediums today, paintings provide a profound lack of stimulation and detail regarding space and time; we have to lend those elements to it ourselves. There is not enough detail to make out most of the dancers in Renoir’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Renoir 1876" target="_blank" title="Renoir PA (1876) Bal du moulin de la Galette [painting]">1876</a>)</span> <em>Bal du moulin de la Galette</em>, not to mention all those that have been chopped off in the framing of the image. But ‘chopped off’ is a photographic way of describing it anyway, inappropriate for a painting. The dancers who are not in the frame, those which Renoir never painted are an essential component of the experience of the image and, in one important sense, the whole point. We are not referring to the closure we see in Gestalt theory, where the incomplete fragments of an object suggest the whole to perception. Rather, the entire purpose of that which was painted is to persuade us towards a more vague and mysterious experience of that which was not. Becoming acquainted with the latter, which is to make our contribution to the painting as viewer, is what pulls us into the picture. If every border, the moment we experience that boundary, spawned a new image, we will have indeed stumbled into Žižek’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>)</span> ‘unbearable closure’. The confinement of the painting directs us towards the mystery of the foreclosure of the lived event of the image as something which cannot be fully described.</div>

<div>Cinema can be described in a mode like this too, not as a moving painting, but as an alternate performance which is an orienting ourselves, our bodies, in relation to the real. Cinema not only enables movement through space within the image itself, but the montage allows images to be juxtaposed and communicate temporally. The role of time here is an important thing to note because comics, McCloud <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#McCloud 1994" target="_blank" title="McCloud S (1994) Understanding comics: the invisible art">1994</a>:7-8)</span> famously illustrates, also juxtapose images sequentially, albeit through space on the page. Next to comics, cinema is the creative evolution of sequential images when the temporal experience of each section has been surrendered over to the machine, or to the film-maker via the machine. This process, along with photography and the cinematographic illusion, enabled the image to become something new, as we have seen Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>; <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> explore. Because we have no control over the camera, a sense of wonder can be constantly evoked through the composition of the shot and montage. The cinema is, in a sense, always beyond us and outside our control and this constitutes the image-event of cinema.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="079" class="position" href="m.html#079" title="The videogame is irreducible as a human event.">079</a></div>

<div>This brings us to a more revealing problematic to be explored in relation to videogames than any attempt at definitions. That is to identify the medium’s point of openness, the location of the event. Where is the irreducible event in the videogame as an image? And this is the same as asking where the human is in the videogame image. This can be answered with a description of how the image is made, or how we collaborate in the production of a videogame image in a way that is unambiguous, on display, part of the image itself, not an interpretation – the image becomes an explicit human event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="080" class="position" href="m.html#080" title="The cinematographic illusion was always a mobile element in the videogame.">080</a></div> 
	<!---link no.--->
<div>At <a title="‘The idea of montage had not yet emerged... “there is therefore no communication of mutually referring variable sets”’" target="_blank" href="#063">063</a> we located illusions of movement in the cinema’s genesis but the same cannot be said of the videogame’s origins because, as I keep saying, the videogame constitutes an entirely different human event, despite its appropriation of cinematographic gestures and notwithstanding my use of cinema to leverage this analysis of the videogame image. In cinema, the illusion was something to grow out of, it had to be transgressed for the sake of its creative evolution. In contrast to this, the early forms of interactive media were text-based, and the cinematographic illusion was later adopted as a supplemental — a spectacle that the industry immediately identified as its quest. Thus, videogames have never needed to mobilise the image, from the beginning the illusion was immediately incorporated as one of many mobile interactive elements.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="081" class="position" href="m.html#081" title="In Street Fighter, illusions of movement are mobilised as illusions.">081</a></div>

<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em> and other 2D fighting games, we will see that the images are mobile, constituting ‘real movement’ in the Bergsonian sense, even when the task of playing the game requires one to understand them as illusions. Though the game’s mechanics are built around the cinematographic illusion, we will identify indivisible movement in the broad interaction that is required to learn and play the game as a dialogic human event. Further, the more in-game animations are considered to be illusions of movement, the more meaning they have in the context of the game and are mobilised as constituents of the event. In <em>Street Fighter</em>, illusions of movement can break down and become real events along a different trajectory, namely player agency and dialogue. This case shows how the effort to think with and along illusions of movement in the context of a videogame image does not compromise the legitimacy of the performance which constitutes a human event. To clarify how this works in <em>Street Fighter</em>, we will need to explore the game’s basic and complex mechanics and what they demand from the player.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="082" class="position" href="m.html#082" title="Frame-data can be central to how Street Fighter is played.">082</a></div>

<div>Playing <em>Street Fighter</em> well can entail a deep understanding of its character animations. This is true to the point where the illusions of movement are broken, and animations are temporarily regarded to be a series of separate equidistant still images. Each character animation has a set number of startup, active and recovery frames. Startup frames describe how many frames of animation take place before any damage is inflicted on the opponent, during which the player is vulnerable. Active frames are those in which an attack does damage if the opponent crosses the path of the action and fails to block. Recovery frames are those frames in which a character is completing the animation and cannot yet commence a new one, during which the player is vulnerable. This ‘frame-data’ can be central to how we play the game, especially at a high level. A familiarity is recommended, at least with the character one plays the most <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Munday <a href="5.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:257)</span>. For example, Sakura’s standing light punch in <em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> has 4 frames on startup, 3 active and 8 recovery compared to her standing heavy punch which has 9 frames on startup, 3 active and 21 recovery <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Capcom <a href="5.html#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>)</span>: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo13()" id="btn13">OPEN</button>

The latter does more damage but requires more startup and recovery frames and is therefore less safe. This vulnerability can be overcome, however, by using combos, i.e. linking certain attacks together so that the proceeding attack connects to or interrupts the recovery frames of the attack before it. Frame-data also plays a role in ‘frame trapping’ which is to create a situation where an opponent’s attack can be interrupted with a counter-attack that has fewer startup frames <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Munday <a href="5.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:260)</span>. Though it is not essential, familiarity with frame-data can make frame trapping possible in many situations. Thus, character animations in <em>Street Fighter</em> come to have meaning beyond the illusions of movement. In many ways, understanding the animations as illusions is important to comprehend the mechanics of the game.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="083" class="position" href="m.html#083" title="Frame-data feeds situational awareness without diminishing spectacle.">083</a></div>

<div>Note that an appreciation of frame-data does not supplant the spectacle of the cinematographic illusion, but can become part of our lived experience with/in/of the image-event. Attempting to combo into a special attack means trying to complete the action within a set number of frames but an awareness of these frames does not diminish the effects of the illusions of movement on perception. Our chances of winning improve as the concept of individual frames comes to determine our actions. The frames constitute the data of a science of <em>Street Fighter;</em> we use frame-data to articulate and think through potential and occurring scenarios, to solve the problems emerging from a lived image-event. Our skills improve in <em>Street Fighter</em> as an awareness of perceived movement <em>as illusion</em> increasingly comes to determine how we play, our decisions and how we, as irreducible beings, live an irreducible event. This learned new orientation towards the image, despite its disassembling the image into separate frames, and despite its abstracting thought away from the perceptions of the body — more than ‘despite’ but through this very process — the image comes to have greater meaning in the immediate lived experience of the player. Players do not count frames in real-time during a match but character animations are manipulated as illusions of movement. The more we play <em>Street Fighter</em> the clearer these features of the image-event become, a different posture is assumed and we are more practised at letting these hidden elements of the image influence our performance. Frame-data plays an important role in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of one’s chosen character in certain situations. The game’s developer, Capcom <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>)</span>, makes all of <em>Street Fighter V’s</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> frame-data available on their website and certain tools in that game’s training mode are designed to facilitate a comprehension of frame-data while practising. Learning to play <em>Street Fighter</em> can now be described as the process of discovering more dialogic aspects within the image-event, but this discovery must be immediately lived, not intellectually or philosophically realised, the experience of the image is not deconstructed or hampered in any way, to play <em>Street Fighter</em> skilfully.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="084" class="position" href="m.html#084" title="So frame-data is non-essential but articulates an unlearning.">084</a></div>

<div>This means frame-data, as a concept, is not essential to play or even win the game, but anyone’s actions within the image will, inevitably and over time, come to account for these symptoms of the image; the player must still navigate these facts of the videogame <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Munday <a href="5.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:256-257)</span>. Playing <em>Street Fighter</em> conditions actions to be partially determined by the fact that the animations in the game are not ‘real movements’. For example, it is possible to learn through trial and error that special attacks can interrupt recovery frames. This phenomenon is only possible because the animations are finite and divisible. Exploiting this fact does not entail cheating or breaking the game but the exact opposite, it is how we succeed in the 2D fighting game genre, it is how these games are meticulously designed to be played and discovered. So, concerning what is perceived as movement in-game, to win at <em>Street Fighter</em> one needs to unlearn what movement is, according to natural intuition, to perform the movement differently, in unnatural ways. This unlearning/unseeing will be comprehended not only intellectually but through the body, through muscle memory which superposes a formal knowledge of frame-data.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="085" class="position" href="m.html#085" title="The ‘science’ of Street Fighter has a limit, unlike natural science.">085</a></div>

<div>What is perceived as movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> is a finite series of still images and comprehending this illusion is a process that resembles scientific inquiry. Outside videogames, to modify real movement or intervene in an action from one’s own body or that of another, we already divide movement artificially <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/1907</a>:191-192)</span>. This process of division can go on forever indefinitely in scientific inquiry, never getting any closer to real movement <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>:214-215)</span>. However, the illusions of movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> are phenomena scientific thought can get to the bottom of, and getting to the ‘bottom’ of game animations will increase the influence we have, as players striving for a win-state, over the videogame image. The animations are divided into sections to intervene in an action, but unlike real movement, this process has an end. The ceiling is rapidly reached, and no further divisions are necessary, the inquiry is complete. A clear definite division separating cause and effect can be easily located. Thus, the future can be grasped in its entirety, the production of the new, its ever upspringing, can be stayed and we can win the game.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="086" class="position" href="m.html#086" title="Combo strings and frame traps pull virtual lines into a win state.">086</a></div>

<div>This is what happens in a combo string. Because the movements are not real and the number of frames is finite, the effect of a cause can be locked in until the string of connected attacks is over. There is no frame gap in which the opponent can intervene a counter and the number of possible actions their avatar can perform has been reduced to zero. At the start of a match, possible illusions of movement orbit each player’s character in a virtual plane.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-3" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-3" aria-hidden="true"><sup>3</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-3"> By ‘virtual’ I do not mean that which is computated but the whole from which potentialities are actualised (see Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1996/2018" target="_blank" title="Deleuze (1996/2018) Bergsonism">1998/2018</a>:60).</div></span> There is potentiality surrounding the character, multiple pathways present themselves before they are forced to coalesce into a single point, a single animation or illusion of movement. A match in <em>Street Fighter</em> can thus be described as a series of fluctuations, with the number of potential actions expanding and shrinking. Each player is attempting to force the virtual lines into a single point which is a win-state. This is accomplished through a performance of the image which accounts for the movement’s nature, as illusions, as was described above in the form of frame-data, to enable frame trapping and strategic combo strings.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="087" class="position" href="m.html#087" title="The creative Street Fighter event negotiates limits and agency.">087</a></div>

<div>From this view, in <em>Street Fighter</em>, autonomy is what generates real, irreducible, movement; agency mobilises still frames through creative unforeseeable gestures. Finite parameters constitute the strategic elements of the game and the deeper the grasp one has of these, the more meaningful, intentional and autonomous one’s actions in the game become. The creative comprehension and manipulation of finite significations is an indivisible movement towards a win-state.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="088" class="position" href="m.html#088" title="The videogame image is an acentred, shared creative event.">088</a></div>

<div>This indivisible path or movement could so far be described as centred, framed via a description of how to win the game, or a single player’s experience with a computer, pushing towards a singular outcome. But the actual event of the videogame image is an acentred movement because multiple agencies are working in a dialogic situation. These forces are in productive conflict in any videogame instance, even in single-player games. It remains for us to examine the constituents of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match as a <em>shared</em> becoming, a single creative event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="089" class="position" href="m.html#089" title="Street Fighter is a dialogic event.">089</a></div>

<div>To play <em>Street Fighter</em> is to participate in an inter-human dialogue, which is both visual and kinaesthetic. During a match, the actions of the opponent, displayed on the monitor, can be regarded as a series of questions which demand a response. These should not be thought of as literal questions, only as impetuses which are directed at the player and which demand action. These questions would lose all meaning if the player was absent, they are what it means to play the game and participate in <em>Street Fighter</em> as an act of dialogue. Responses are, in turn, also questions to an opponent and what is shared in this mutuality constitutes the novel dialogue of the game. This is only made possible through the unique visual language of illusions of movement provided by the game’s developers via the apparatus.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="090" class="position" href="m.html#090" title="The dialogic interplay constitutes and ‘in-betweenness’.">090</a></div>

<div>This dialogue is irreducible, however, and the separate elements of question and answer can mislead us from this fact. The question precedes the response in time, it anticipates a response, but the question has not become fully actualised, its full meaning and implications do not emerge, until after the answer has been given. The question to which the action was a reply becomes suddenly more apparent, it becomes Real. But an answer is also a question and that question will be constantly renewed, taking on new meaning and becoming mobilised in the unfolding events of a match. This new meaning cannot be predicted just as an opponent’s emerging response will continue to introduce new and unforeseen elements. The dialogue itself is not located in the back-and-forth motion of question and answer. It happens in neither the question nor the answer, not in one player or the other or the developer’s anticipations. It is, following Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>; <a href="5.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>)</span> here, in the in-betweenness of the participants.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="091" class="position" href="m.html#091" title="We will pursue some of Buber’s distinctions.">091</a></div>

<div>We can come closer to understanding the shared creative act of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match by furthering this resemblance to Buberian dialogue and borrowing some distinctions Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10-12)</span> made, namely ‘observing’, ‘looking on’ and ‘becoming aware’.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-4" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-4" aria-hidden="true"><sup>4</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-4"> We should not employ these terms as a means of distinguishing different phenomena because every videogame image (and every image generally) can be regarded in a way that is dialogic. Rather, the terms should be regarded as a means of distinguishing the different ways <em>we</em> orient ourselves towards the phenomena and not as a description of the phenomena itself. The examples I use below belie false distinctions within the phenomena itself, but they do represent instances where the orientation in question comes more easily, so let them stand.</div></span></div>

But dialogue will never emerge from our interaction with this dummy, its animations will be learnt in a rote manner and only ‘observed’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Buber <a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10)</span>. That is, we can accumulate recognisable traits and patterns that can be memorised and this can play an important part of what is required to improve one’s skills and anticipate the sequence of moves we have programmed, but this only points towards and cannot replace the dialogic act of playing a match where indetermination extends beyond us into an otherness.</div>

<div>A deeper understanding can come from describing what Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10)</span> calls ‘the onlooker’. Here, we disregard any attempt to learn individual elements, remember or even acknowledge them. The phenomenon is taken as a whole, as a single impression. We say to ourselves, ‘I will not try to “figure out” my opponent in a deliberate and calculated way, I will seize the advantages that come from skipping all that, looking passed separate elements or instances at something more complete’. This gesture, like observing, plays an important role in the process of learning the game and winning a match. There is a general awareness that only comes from prolonged experience with the game, which also applies to the non-specific comprehension of an opponent. While this can bring us closer to the human or object that is our subject in many ways, we have not yet arrived at the kind of awareness and state that is only made possible through dialogue.</div>

What is being displayed on the monitor ‘speaks something that enters into [our] own life’ and demands our immediate action <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Buber <a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:11)</span>.

A film or book can say things that feel unique and personal based on how we interpret a text, but these are subjective; what is unique in videogames, the novelty that is emerging, is shared between <em>us</em> in that moment and is incomplete. This is a novelty that we <em>become aware</em> of because we are part of its emergence.</div>

<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em>, the fact that there are win and lose states distracts us from the dialogic nature of the phenomenon, but the competitiveness of the game does not inhibit dialogue. Competition entails more than setting one’s opponent at a distance from oneself to establish difference — I won, you lost.

This phenomenon amounts to something of a violence on our person, on that distance presupposed, an attack on the objectification of the other,</div>

<div>A distance is present before a match begins, and a distance is established by the outcome of the match, but these facts should only throw into relief for us what is mutual during the match itself.</div>

In <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, the opponent’s avatar becomes a piece of meat that is played with for laughs in a variety of ways to celebrate victory. It must be acknowledged that this spectacle is completely at odds with the entering into relation that dialogue entails. What once represented an opponent has become a dead object to be controlled. There is no mutual confirmation of alternative truths to be reconciled. Here, the violent image ignores the contradiction of the other. But these images are not what will inevitably come to determine one’s actions in a match. We can conceive of instances when a particular move is performed for the sake of how it demonstrates dominance over an opponent, but <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boon <a href="5.html#Boon 2019" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2019) Mortal kombat 11 [videogame]">2019</a>)</span> requires a strategic application of the illusions of movement in the same way <em>Street Fighter</em> does. These rapidly come to determine our actions more than the visual appeal of the perceived movements themselves, realistic graphics or violence. The last of these stands out, because of how violence seems most clearly at odds with what is generally perceived as productive dialogue. But illusions of movement in general, or any gesture towards realism can also be construed as a type of violence against the irreducible because everything becomes its object. In contrast, dialogue, as Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>)</span> presents it, describes a posture in which otherness contributes to an event, which we are also a part of, but our intentions are directed towards the event itself and not its otherness. 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="097" class="position" href="m.html#097" title="Videogames entail a participation in a mutual becoming.">097</a></div>

<div>This description of <em>Street Fighter</em> as dialogue, can now serve our framing of videogames around the Bergsonian philosophy of the new. There are unprecedented game-states that the developers could not have anticipated — they can only create fences. Though the computer contains, in its programming, a finite list of possible actions, it cannot predict what our next action will be. It can only take a catalogue of all previous actions and become along with us. In videogames we participate in a new instance of movement, real novelty because to play a videogame is to be more than a consumer, it is to participate in a mutual becoming, which works to produce the image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="098" class="position" href="m.html#098" title="The apparatus is not excluded as subject and object dissolves.">098</a></div>

<div>Humans participate together to form a videogame image in a shared movement and this does not exclude the apparatus. One can have a dialogic encounter with a piece of nature or art or whenever we become with an object, where it ceases to be an object for us, and we slide together into an in-betweenness. This phenomenon, in the case of videogames, can be observed in a very literal sense. There is a shared dependency between the human and the apparatus to perform a mutual transformation. The thing that is evolving resides in neither party alone but is a literal coming together, a single movement like Bergson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:285)</span> description of perception. When we play <em>Street Fighter</em> and are not pulling ourselves out of the act of play through deliberate objectification of the game or an opponent, the schism separating subject and object is abandoned as non-essential to the image-event and is a philosophical distraction from our performance of the image as real event. This is the case even while playing alone against the computer. Our movements become the illusions of ‘real movement’ on the screen, for there is no definite threshold separating ourselves and all other elements we could identify as contributing to the videogame image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="099" class="position" href="m.html#099" title="Multiplayer instances acentre the dialogic image-event.">099</a></div>

<div>In multiplayer instances, a creative event shared between a player, developers and hardware is what enters into relation with another human opponent to form another image, another possible framing of an irreducible event. In this instance, it is even harder to discern or justify a dialogic centre and in one sense the event becomes more real or decisions have more interpersonal weight. Playing <em>Street Fighter</em> against another person is, for most people, always preferable. There is a realness to the movements, even while playing against a stranger online, that is absent against the computer or against what the game’s development team have anticipated. We could describe multiplayer as a dialogue between two players that is mediated by a machine and developers, like two dialogues entering into a third dialogue. But this suggests that multiple creative acts are happening simultaneously, which is misleading. We can artificially distinguish separate elements, separate dialogic gestures, but the shared becoming itself should ultimately be regarded as a single human event – where parameters lose meaning.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="100" class="position" href="m.html#100" title="Players and developers depend on each other to produce the videogame image.">100</a></div>

<div>This shared becoming between humans and machines is further complicated when we consider a temporally offset dialogue happening between players and game developers. With a computer, the developer lays out a finite plane predicting and responding to every possible action from the player, enabling and restricting, expanding and shrinking possible actions. To then play the game entails cutting a path through that finite plane, replacing the possible with the potential, the finite with the virtual. We are never playing a videogame by ourselves because there is a constant and indirect collaboration with the developers to create the emerging image-event. What makes this exchange irreducible and dialogic is that the path itself cannot be foreseen because of player and developer agency – except a temporal dissonance makes this mutuality uneven.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-5" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-5" aria-hidden="true"><sup>5</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-5"> This uneven power distribution is resolved in the lived event of playing a videogame, if we regard it as being ‘determined-in-the-last-instance’ (see Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:125).</div></span> The content of the plane, prior to the game’s development, cannot be predicted because developing a game is its own creative act. However, the game’s gesture is incomplete until it is actioned by a player and when a player performs an action the developer’s response has literally already taken place. Player and developer mutually depend on each other in a shared production of the new.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="101" class="position" href="m.html#101" title="Videogames give us an incomplete mutual inheritance to become with.">101</a></div>

<div>This final dialogue between developers and players serves to show how many different elements are being brought into relation in the event of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match. We can artificially isolate separate dialogic instances of mutual becoming, one between the human and the apparatus, another between two humans in the moment of a match and another between the player and developer. These disparate participants should be regarded as converging elements that form a single creative and social event. While Goffman <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Goffman 1967" target="_blank" title="Goffman E (1967) Interaction ritual: essays on face-to-face behaviour">1963</a>:17)</span> extended the scope of social situations to encompass ‘physical copresence, tele-phonic connection or letter exchange’, there is both an immediacy and potentiality to videogames which makes them unique. The player enters into a becoming where agency is central, but there is also a kind of submission to larger pre-planned transformations. The emergence taking place is based on a mutual inheritance which has already partially happened and yet remains unresolved.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="102" class="position" href="m.html#102" title="We can assign to videogames like Street Fighter an autonomy, as independent, irreducible events.">102</a></div>

<div>Notwithstanding the technical feat involved in the broad phenomenon that is <em>Street Fighter</em> and the extent to which it has been created in this respect, by virtue of the coalescence of multiple dialogic elements, it remains fundamentally a becoming that is facilitated by technology. Like Handelman’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Handelman 2005" target="_blank" title="Handelman D (2005) ‘Introduction: why ritual in Its own right? how so?’">2005</a>)</span> picture of ritual, <em>Street Fighter</em> and other videogames can be assigned their own autonomy and are thus independent happenings. This has a tendency of being masked when we are distracted by the spectacle of the apparatus itself in the quantitative pursuit of realism or violence. As we have seen, identifying the videogame too closely with other mediums like cinema is a potential source of misdirection, away from the irreducible human event. This can also be true of animation.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="103" class="position" href="m.html#103" title="‘Animation’, here, is a means of collaborative image production.">103</a></div>

<div>I have used the word ‘animation’ above, along the way of describing the dialogic event which produces a videogame image with specific reference to <em>Street Fighter</em>. Animation can also be regarded as a separate medium, distinct from both cinema and videogames, but here we will regard it as a means or method which can be employed in cinema or videogames in the process of producing an image. Other image methods could include the camera, the gamepad controlling the camera, the game engine, etc. — none of which replace animation but together with animation codetermine the image. Animation is a means of producing an image by generating frames. Videogame players work with developers and artists, in a small capacity in terms of labour but in a large capacity in terms of the decisive last instant which chooses the next frame, to produce an animated image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="104" class="position" href="m.html#104" title="Animation is non-essential, but can inspire new styles and compromises.">104</a></div>

<div>Animation is not an essential feature of videogames. The videogame event employs animation for what it can lend to the image. We can see this in the history of Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Here is a battle sequence from each major entry in the franchise, from 1987 to 2016: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo15()" id="btn15">OPEN</button>

We can see the number and extent of animated elements increase as such opportunities present themselves through advancing technologies. Animation is inserted or applied to the specific instances of gameplay where it has something to contribute. If it is applied with excess, this can have an impact on game design and gameplay; it can affect the possibilities of unfolding dialogue. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nomura et al. <a href="5.html#Nomura 2020" target="_blank" title="Nomura T, Hamaguchi N and Toriyama M (directors) (2020) Final fantasy vii remake [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> is worth noting again here, for how it attempts to reconcile the re-creation of nostalgic and familiar game elements in a way that also fulfils current expectations pertaining to animation in AAA videogames. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> behaves like a standard 3D action game until the ATB (active time battle) gauge is full. Then the action can be paused, for players to strategically select more powerful attacks, items or spells. Only, the animations have not paused entirely, gameplay is effectively paused but the animations still move in very slow motion which creates the feeling of passing time, as we can see here: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo16()" id="btn16">OPEN</button>

There is a refusal here to return to the static images of the franchise’s early instalments and animation lends itself to the conveyance of an unfolding event, an event that has always been present even when full animations were impossible. The slowdown in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is the animation’s acquiescence to larger gameplay agendas, a compromise between conflicting dialogue styles or the discovery of a new style.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="105" class="position" href="m.html#105" title="Animation helps to convey the image as an event.">105</a></div> 

<div>The animation can lend itself to the videogame event, to convey the image as an event, but it must just as frequently yield to gameplay. This submission has been described as a point of good game design. Animation is the crux where developers communicate a game’s most important information, the possibilities of the unfolding image, to the player. This was described above in the case of <em>Street Fighter</em> at <a title="‘This “frame-data” can be central to how we play the game, especially at a high level’." target="_blank" href="#082">082</a>; start-up frames are an intrinsic part of game design in fighting games. They are also an essential element of fighting game animation because they are necessary for communication, for the developer to communicate the possibilities of the image to the player, for the player to communicate and accommodate for their opponent’s recognition of their intentions, the broadcasting of their choices within the image itself.</div>

 <div>Videogames have discovered and developed a particular animation style that fulfils the needs of dialogue.

Rayman feels fast and snappy because the player can initiate the jump at any moment: from the middle of a roll, hanging on a ledge or the moment Rayman’s feet touch the ground, we can jump again. <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo17()" id="btn17">OPEN</button>

I took notes in the margins and underlined passages which seemed to conflict with, or reveal certain aspects of, the phenomenon of the fighting game I had immersed myself in. I can recall one, perhaps imagined case of Deleuze mentioning animation in that read-through but have since been unable to locate it. ‘Animation’ does not appear in the index of <em>Cinema 1</em> or <em>Cinema 2</em>. I opened a PDF of each book — the object on my shelf has become an event on my monitor full of potentialities. I perform an OCR (optical character recognition) scan using <em>Adobe Acrobat Pro DC</em> (Adobe <a href="5.html#Adobe 1993" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1993) Adobe acrobat [software]">1993</a>) on the PDF document to convert it into searchable text, press Crtl + F, type ‘animation’ and press enter. Between the two books there is only one instance of that word occurring. It is possible the OCR failed to recognise particular instances like, for example, if the word ‘animation’ were spread across two lines with a hyphen. That single occurrence of ‘animation’ is in an endnote on page 230 in reference to Vertov (cited in Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:230). This is the bases of my conclusion that Deleuze has no interest in animation and my reading of the text with a mind preoccupied with frame-data and character animations was not to extract a theory of animation that can be applied to the cinema; I was thinking about videogames via the cinema in a way that is similar to how this page commenced, leveraging the theoretical and conceptual maturity of ideas about an entirely different medium to stimulate original thought by challenging them in a new mode foreign to them.</div></span> 
We can take an animated film and easily identify within it whatever varieties of movement-image we can discern, ignoring the fact that these images have been accomplished through animation. What animation does for the cinema takes place along a different line of thought.

Bird’s response came to the defence of animation as ‘its own thing’ against images of movement captured through a camera. Photorealism, ‘…is not the reason to do animation anyway, the reason to do animation is caricature’. In these terms, animation is more than the reduction of an image into its essence, it is the enhancement of those faculties which make it distinct, specifically pertaining to movement. This caricature of movement can be implemented and lend itself to the cinema or the videogame but in each case, it is fulfilling a different need, contributing to a different event. Animation serves the cinema in reference to narrative and character, and though these are still relevant factors in how a game tells its story, animation in the videogame also must communicate to everyone involved in the event the possibilities and outcomes of the image as a dialogic event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="108" class="position" href="m.html#108" title="Street Fighter’s real movement was discovered in a different mode.">108</a></div>

<div>One of my first naive goals for this project, in the early stages of its conceptualisation, was to describe real movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> à la the movement-image Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> identified in cinema. The failure of this intention is what bore fruit, revealing how radically different the videogame is from the cinema. For it seemed that, according to Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> analysis of primitive cinema, <em>Street Fighter</em> ought to entail the cinematographic illusion par excellence. But <em>Street Fighter</em>, and videogames more generally, need to be regarded as an entirely separate phenomenon with a radically different essence so as to make this connection invalid. If we take player agency to be the fundamental gesture of interactive media (developers are players too), the image is immediately mobilised according to the same Bergsonian definitions of movement Deleuze employed, albeit in a completely different way.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="109" class="position" href="m.html#109" title="Humans, non-humans, and temporally displaced humans coalesce into an image-event.">109</a></div>

<div>If videogames are regarded as events with their own evolving autonomy, we must acknowledge that they are unique and unprecedented in this regard. Their finite elements often include the generation and navigation of a spatial plane along a set of predetermined parameters, but in <em>Street Fighter</em> we have shown that these parameters can harbour infinite significance when their conception becomes the object of human striving and when they are integrated into the irreducible gestures of dialogue. The multifaceted nature of the event also makes it unique; videogames entail a creative evolution that is shared between disparate parties including the human, the non-human and the temporally displaced human. These coalesce in a single unpredictable moment that is its own autonomous event. Deleuze <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>:280)</span> regarded filmmakers as philosophers, he did philosophy with the cinema, but videogames need to happen to anthropology (<a title="This project is to let videogames happen to anthropology (and anthropology to videogames)." href="1.html#012" target="_blank">012</a>). That is, they need to emerge for us as human events which take place within the process of producing an image. Videogames are presently interhuman and in them we can see the emerging human; a videogame is produced as an event, not an object.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="110" class="position" href="m.html#110" title="The videogame has invited us to assume a new posture, within the event itself.">110</a></div>

<div>We have previously framed the videogame image as an object to be understood because we started on familiar ground, namely the cinema. Not only that, we began from a place that could motivate this project, so that the videogame was transcendent (not transcendental), external, Other, an object to ask questions about and to be understood. The videogame’s difference in relation to the cinema, its lack of a Deleuzian movement-image, was leveraged to discover the videogame image as an open dialogic event. But we cannot separate from this discovery an implicit challenge to our original question, which posed the videogame image as an object. We <em>can</em> preserve the image-object by simply pushing it outside the image-event; the image is a by-product of what has been described. Then our descriptions of the videogame as an interhuman, complex social event on its own terms, specifically according to how we play <em>Street Fighter</em>, pose no threat to the integrity of the unaddressed image which perhaps cannot be described or does not need to be described because <em>it is its own description of itself</em>. But of course, both these can be true for anything and, rather, they describe postures we assume more than any <em>thing</em> we are trying to understand. This is our current posture: in a competitive <em>Street Fighter</em> match, we try to force the image to actualise in a certain way, and so does our opponent and so are/were all the developers. Our collective actions are pointed towards the resolution of this indeterminate object: the image. This took some work, the paradigm meets resistance, because software, as a general phenomenon, as a commodity, hides even the event of its production, framing itself <em>only</em> as an object which is consumed or ‘played’ in a non-complex and uni-directional manner. Let the dialogic event of image production, as it has been revealed above, now stand. It remains for us to accept the videogame’s invitation to assume a posture for which there is no image-object, which posture is the discovery of the <em>transcendental image</em>. So rather than acting on the videogame object for the purposes of analysis, our new goal is to experience the videogame event acting on us. This means recognising in the above initial analysis an invitation to assume a new posture, which demands we forsake our goals towards the full elucidation of the videogame image, discrete and novel in relation to other mediums, and let the videogame change how we think about all mediums. So the task becomes for us to better come to terms with this posture, to recognise that we are part of the image itself, to further frame the videogame image as transcendental.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="111" class="position" href="m.html#111" title="We anticipate a trajectory into the transcendental image.">111</a></div>

<div>The term or concept ‘computer graphics’ is a symptom of a mode of thought, an intellectual posture which is a new location for the image-object after the discovery of the image-event, meaning the above discovery of the dialogic event in <em>Street Fighter</em> as it pertains to the videogame phenomenon and ultimately images generally. The persistence of ‘computer graphics’ or ‘computer-generated images’ is how the dialogic event can still entail an orientation where the image is something we consume or produce, where the image appears as the by-product of an event. So far, the transcendental image has been mentioned but not yet discovered for the sake of the big way of performing <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>. Our path to this will be a new problematic with computer graphics in mind, where the image’s primary source, the device, is yet to be fully explored. Below we will see that regardless of how said device produces the image to be consumed (it could be rasterized or ray-traced on a CRT, LCD, OLED, etc.) the event of these technologies constitutes an instance of the human body participating in a complex dialogic event. Beyond users as consumers and devices as producers, the user’s role as producer <em>de jure,</em> and their merger with the device itself, will be revealed. This can be called our discovery of a more basic dialogue unfolding between the user and device, where the device (a monitor, television, smartphone, Gameboy Advance, Neo Geo Pocket, etc.), accounts for a more active and complex element of the dialogic event this page has so far been describing. The upshot here will be a further receding of the image-object to finally reveal a way of regarding the videogame image as transcendental. To honour what we have been developing and our burgeoning new understanding of the videogame, we will not regard a device to be the sole giver of digital images by not referring to the images in question as ‘computer-generated images’. The body and the screen are mere constituents within an image-event which will now be further brought into focus.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="112" class="position" href="m.html#112" title="An image-object depends on specific bodily and intellectual postures, not devices.">112</a></div>

<div>We have already seen that, ultimately, the device’s function in an image-event is not simply to give our perceptual organs an image to receive. The experience of the digital image cannot be separated from other, more fundamental aspects of the event like user and developer intentionalities. This already means that the images we feel we ‘receive’ from our displays hold a special quality. Before we even think of them as images, they are distinct from the objects we say they represent. This is to say, they are specially perceived or set apart from other objects in the world in the act of perception itself prior to thought. This aligns with a more basic intuition; of course, we are never fooled by the image into thinking it otherwise, into thinking we are actually looking at the thing-that-an-image-is-of, and neither are our bodies. This is because viewing a digital image, the simple act of looking presupposes a specific set of perceptual or bodily postures. These presuppositions can be summarised as the giving of one’s body over to the event. Put differently, the human experiences an embodied and dialogic relationship with the image, which is contextualised and dependent on a broader situation rooted in the physicality of the device and its meaning; i.e., sitting at a desk, turning on a computer, putting a VR headset on or pulling out a smartphone, are to get into position, to orient the screen in relation to the body and go through these pre-perceptual manoeuvres to put the body in an event. Inasmuch as humans are consumers, they allow their bodies to be consumed in order to consume. The device’s function in the event is to make a space for our bodies and the image is not <em>in</em> the device; the device, in itself, does not produce the image because the actualisation of an image-object depends on specific bodily and intellectual postures.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="113" class="position" href="m.html#113" title="Photorealism does not deceive the body, but invites us into an event.">113</a></div>

<div>The body is not captured by realism attributed to an already fully emerged and existing image but is, rather, instrumentalised and made into an object. The device does not imitate styles from the natural world familiar to our sensory organs to give our bodies the experience of an image. Instead, an image-event occurs via the aforementioned embodied performance with the device. One does not see a tree outside only to later discover it is a rasterized image. A rasterized tree on a computer monitor could be mistaken for a photo, but the error lies in the assignment of the wrong imaging technology to a particular case; while the type of image can be brought into question, the fact that it is an image on a monitor cannot. This is because its status, as an image, emerges from a more basic presupposed condition, namely the event. Our bodies perform and perceive a tree as an event with a monitor before we contemplate how it was generated as an image. We can marvel at the photorealism of a rasterized tree but photorealism’s goal and its achievement is not to fool our bodies, though this is the project’s understanding of itself. From the perspective of lived performance, photorealism invites into the image-event an idea that can change the posture we assume in relation to our bodies. To celebrate photorealism is to applaud an image-object, but this framed object and the act of applause itself are parts of an event being brought into dialogic relation with other parts, particularly our bodies. We can demonstrate two levels from which to view photorealism, like this:

	<ul> 
		<li>The image-event invites the formulation of an image-object, which is to give space for the following performance:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The image-object resembles something in the natural world, but this is an illusion, the body has been ‘tricked’.</li>
		</ul> 
	</ul>

The latter of these affirms the instrumentalisation of the body, leading to both its circumscription and the feeling of it being played with.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="114" class="position" href="m.html#114" title="The videogame event involves a shared posture, often towards realism.">114</a></div>

<div>Below we will see how videogame graphics can demonstrate this more effectively than other imaging technologies because the videogame industry often values realism-enabling technologies, like ray tracing or path tracing, beyond aesthetics and for the sake of user participation. Ray tracing does not merely look good, it <em>feels</em> good to perform on/with the screen. The developer, player and device aspire to cast and trace some rays through a virtual world that is mutually dependent on all participants. We participate in this event with our bodies and unintentional but welcome, things are happening to our bodies — or to perception — because we are not the only actors. This experience relies on our regarding the event of image perception, both pre-reflectively and explicitly, in a particular way.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="115" class="position" href="m.html#115" title="‘Computer graphics’ instrumentalise the body and make space for particular image-events.">115</a></div>

<div>And this can show at the outset, before elaborating or revealing the transcendental nature of the videogame image, that computer graphics are not an illusion (which is obvious) but derive value from (1) the way they demonstrate popular Cartesian philosophical stances pertaining to the instrumentalisation of the body and (2) the way they make space for the body to participate in image-events, in particular ways which lead to valued events. These points, and the transcendental image, will receive more attention below, starting with what Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:32)</span> said concerning colour:</div> 

	<blockquote class="small">The first perception of colors, properly so called, is thus a change in the structure of consciousness, the institution of a new dimension of experience, and the deployment of an <em>a priori</em>.</blockquote>

<div>And the same can be said of pixels performing said colour in new ways, like ray-traced reflections in <em>Cyber Punk 2077</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Badowski et al. <a href="5.html#Badowski 2020" target="_blank" title="Badowski A, Tomaszkiewicz K and Amatangelo G (directors) (2020) Cyber Punk 2077 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>:

    </figure>

<div><em>After</em> seeing this image, I can think about how it is being generated by a computer and can push to align my experience with that knowledge. That is, I can make an abstraction on top of the <em>a priori</em> given through perception, replacing the mountains, trees and clouds with an array of pixels changing colour. They change colour according to a process called rasterization, which works by starting with an object — like a mountain or a cloud — and placing that object on a grid that represents the computer monitor. Algorithms also interject to alter the colours of the pixels according to which object is in front of another, like a cloud floating in front of a mountain.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="117" class="position" href="m.html#117" title="The image is seen before it is realised and abstractions occlude the body.">117</a></div>
 <!--link no.-->
<div>While doing this can replace perceived images with pixels changing colour sixty times per second, this experience is an application of knowledge that steps over the simpler and embodied initial episode; it is not a true return to the base of things. We can break the image up, after the fact of perception on the device’s terms, with the device as our starting point, but this occludes the role of the body. Abstracting on the device’s terms is a similar operation to those performed earlier at <a title="‘Observing’ is rote memorization." target="_blank" href="#092">092</a> (observing) and <a title="The ‘onlooker’ takes the phenomenon as a whole." target="_blank" href="#093">093</a> (onlooking), in that it displaces the image-object to a new location where it still functions as something we consume; the image is what these complex objects and events are here to provide. In contrast, our initial participation in the image-event, with our bodies and prior to conscious reflection, takes that experience as a whole in the first instance, and each successive frame is a new first instance. The consumed image is not something we assemble. The videogame image, like visual art, is seen before it is realised. This is unlike the image conceived as this website or a book or <em>a</em> videogame, i.e. a specific experience that must be read or played through, perhaps multiple times before we can orient ourselves in relation to its image or generate the whole image that is a work, for ourselves <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Merleau-Ponty <a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:223)</span>.

In this sense, the image has a certain hold on us and the event of seeing the image has changed us forever.</div>

<div>This process can be regarded as transcendental in that it is a condition of experience. To opt out of this event would be to never see what the image is of, to never click and reveal the image, undermining the intentionality that is the condition for its existence. Even the artist steps back once the picture is complete to appreciate the whole, to see it as a landscape and to behold what their process of abstraction has achieved, thereby giving themselves over to it. Now that its composition is complete and we behold it, the mountain or landscape will henceforth be the premise of all thought concerning the phenomenon. We have, as Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:32)</span> told us at <a title="‘Computer graphics’ instrumentalise the body." target="_blank" href="#115">115</a>, ‘the deployment of an <em><em>a priori</em>’</em>.</div>

<div>Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:13)</span> assertion that ‘the perceived world is the always presupposed foundation of all rationality, all value and all existence’ applies equally to images when we regard them as things we encounter in the natural world and disregard their status as mediums containing produced content. For now, never-mind the medium, McLuhan <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#McLuhan 1964" target="_blank" title="McLuhan M (1964/2013) Understanding media: the extensions of man">1964/2013</a>)</span>, only look at the content. It arrives complete. And after a detailed exploration of the complex social, political and technological forces working to deliver that content, we look back at the image, but nothing has changed. We cannot <em>not</em> see the image because the real source of the image is the involuntary, pre-reflective, transcendental force of our bodies. The moment an image’s composition is complete, regardless of our previous dialogic (as we have described them) contributions to that process, the image is suddenly a new thing to be perceived. And the videogame is <em>always</em> a new image.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="122" class="position" href="m.html#122" title="The videogame image is transcendental notwithstanding contextualisations.">122</a></div>

<div>The videogame image, as transcendental image synonymous with the image-event, as novel perceptual event, precedes contextualisations in memory or conjecture (be it in relation to narrative elements or gameplay mechanics). We will hold these contextualisations as symptoms of a posture, which is pointed away from the lived event, that is, a way of regarding the videogame image which supposes an authority over terms and conditions belonging to the transcendental image as immanent performance. While the image-event can stimulate our recollection of broader circumstances and we can deliberately bring those circumstances to bear on our thoughtful and intentional participation in the performance of an image, this recall can feel like the removal of a part of ourselves from the image-event, or more precisely, in such instances our contribution to the event has fundamentally changed because the lived event has become an object for us, namely an object to comprehend or manipulate. The more we play a videogame and align ourselves with and contribute to the event it is predisposed towards, as an unfinished event, the less we abstract the image into an object and the more we unconsciously accept the image’s <em>a priori</em> status, the less we think as bodies in a chair and the more we think as an image or in the style the image-event needs us to think to fulfil our contribution, when we think at all — often the performance does not parent a thought.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="123" class="position" href="m.html#123" title="How to dodge arrows in Spelunky 2.">123</a></div>

<div>This is why we can rarely recall specific runs in <em>Spelunky 2</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Yu <a href="5.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>, especially after playing for a while. Performing that type of image effectively involves leaning into the event. That is, giving more of our pre-reflective bodily states to it. Decisions are made on impulse to fulfil how the videogame image is wont to become. The event that is our person is becoming the image-event. For example, dodging arrows in <em>Spelunky 2</em> is not a measured or calculated procedure but a spontaneous, evolving and creative emergence. The arrow dodge is not seen, calculated, memorised or  constructed — it happens: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo18()" id="btn18">OPEN</button> 
    <script>
        function toggleVideo18() {

<div>And here we are referring to the orientation necessary to perform the arrow dodge in the moment, not how it is thought about before or after the fact, not modes that separate the human from the emergence we will later designate to be an arrow dodge. We refer to the mode in which it is true that, in a very important sense, one <em>feels</em> the arrow move passed and miss the playable character, which is how we get a feel for the arrows and learn how to dodge them. Like Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:144-145)</span> description of a cane, the arrow’s speed is something you experiment with and get a feel for via the performance of it, as an extension of our bodies:</div> 
	<blockquote class="small">If I want to become habituated to a cane, I try it out, I touch some objects and, after some time, I have it ‘in hand’: I see which objects are ‘within reach’ or out of reach of my cane. This has nothing to do with a quick estimate or a comparison between the objective length of the cane and the objective distance of the goal to be reached. Places in space are not defined as objective positions in relation to the objective position of our body, but rather they inscribe around us the variable reach of our intentions and our gestures. To habituate oneself to a hat, an automobile, or a cane is to take up residence in them, or inversely, to make them participate within the voluminosity of one’s own body. Habit expresses the power we have of dilating our being in the world, or of altering our existence through incorporating new instruments.</blockquote>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="125" class="position" href="m.html#125" title="We perceive Spelunky 2 by performing it as an event in the natural world.">125</a></div>

<div>Our flow state with an image is possible because the image is <em>not</em> the product of some rationalism. It is an event happening to a device and we, as bodies, can become with that event and we habitually call this event ‘the image’. In this sense, it is not a ‘virtual’ event, in the way ‘virtual’ is referred to in ‘virtual reality’, but an event in the perceived world. We perceive the arrow in <em>Spelunky 2</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Yu <a href="5.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> by performing it with our bodies and incorporating the playable character into the ‘voluminosity’ of our bodies.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="126" class="position" href="m.html#126" title="We can think on the image-event’s terms without performing an abstraction.">126</a></div>

<div>Not all thought and conscious reflection within the image-event instrumentalises our bodies and generates an image-object. There are frequent moments where we think and reflect according to the image-event, on its terms so as not to fold back and circumscribe the source of the ‘image’. An instance of this was represented above, in the image of me throwing a dog at the arrow trap to set it off.</div>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/figure 10.jpg" alt="" border="0" class="center">
        <figcaption class="small" aria-hidden="true"><a href="5.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">Figure 10</a>: <em>Spelunky 2</em> dog sacrifice</figcaption>
    </figure>

<div>I did not say to myself, ‘I want the image on this monitor to resemble a cartoon dog getting impaled by an arrow, so I will push these keys on my keyboard in this particular way’, etc. My thought process was on the image’s terms, within the world of the image, direct to the ‘fiction’ being performed: ‘I see there’s a trap there — too risky to dodge or whip it — I’ll just throw the dog — it’ll probably survive’. And in instances like this, we are yet to perform an abstraction, we think with the image as if it were infinite and it <em>is</em> infinite via the participation of our bodies, inasmuch as the body is an infinite object. No thought escapes contributing to the event and the force of thought is only concerned with performance and does not bother to comprehend the whole of a circumstance. The event is its own representation or is not concerned with representation because it merely performs its own conditions as transcendental.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="127" class="position" href="m.html#127" title="An image’s status as transcendental is not undermined by production history.">127</a></div>

<div>To say that the image is transcendental and <em>a priori</em> is not a reference to chronology. Something so obviously and intentionally planned and constructed as a videogame entails a process and history. However, these processes, when brought to bear on this lived, open and unresolved event in front of us, accounts for the videogame in a way that separates the human from its emergence in the instance of its happening. This way of framing the videogame fails to describe what the human being has and is becoming via their participation in the image-event. ‘Fictional’ contextualisations within the image itself, like the videogame’s story or mechanics, can be closer, but only while they are considered on the image-event’s terms, as we just saw.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="128" class="position" href="m.html#128" title="Performances of historical contextualization should make way for a new image.">128</a></div>

<div>The immanent, lived experience of videogames is involved in how videogames are made because the videogame image is always <em>new</em>. Playing a videogame is an inseparable part of its past and continuing development (including mods, updates, etc.). The developers had to labour over this, already happening, becoming, evolving image to produce a finished product, which we then purchase. The intention to <em>play</em> <em>Spelunky 2</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Yu <a href="5.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>, <em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> or <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Druckmann et al. <a href="5.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> is to regard these experiences as objects but to play these games well, <em>as videogames</em>, these performances of historical contextualisation must make way for a <em>new image</em>. And it is in this mode of performing a new image, the present image, where the image is mere site for us to point our actions towards rather than a thing to comprehend, this is where the transcendental nature of the videogame image is acknowledged, where the human is performed and respected as irreducible.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="129" class="position" href="m.html#129" title="Images are transcendental but also entail a distinct posture.">129</a></div>

<div>We can regard all images as transcendental, as <em>a priori</em> sites of performation, not only digital images or the videogame image though they do constitute a special case as has been said. In the same way Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span> concepts apply to our entire experience of the perceived world and not only when we are thinking about the act of perception itself, abstracting an image-object. Notwithstanding this, there are aspects of the performance of images that are responsible for our regarding such events as images, which now ought to be further elucidated. To do this, we will regard the image in more general terms. We do not behold visual images — photographs, paintings, films or videogames — like we do other phenomena perceived in the natural world because this act of perception entails a different posture. To proceed further, this difference will need to be explored, non-specific to any medium, highlighting those aspects which set our performance of (in) an image apart. This will explain how images generate a body-subject while concealing other aspects of the event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="130" class="position" href="m.html#130" title="The image-event is compared to non-image-events.">130</a></div>
 <!--link no.-->		
<div>The image constitutes a distinct perceptual event, which points back to the process of perception and, in this way, it points back to our bodies as perceiving subjects. At <a title="We do not think, assemble or deduce an image." target="_blank" href="#119">119</a> we used Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:222)</span> description of perceiving the sky and likened it to the experience of perceiving Cézanne’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Cézanne 1905" target="_blank" title="Cézanne P (circa 1905) Mont Sainte-Victoire [painting]">1905</a>)</span> painting or at <a title="Rasterisation is described on a monitor." target="_blank" href="#116">116</a> a rasterized mountain from <em>The Witcher 3</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Badowski et al. <a href="5.html#Tomaszkiewicz 2015" target="_blank" title="Tomaszkiewicz K, Kanik M and Stępień S (directors) (2015) The witcher 3: wild hunt [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. But Merleau-Ponty was not describing the experience of perceiving an image, and while these examples sufficed for our above purposes, there remains a distinction to be drawn. An image of a mountain constitutes a different human event to the beholding of a real mountain because the image is dialogic in an inter-human sense, it has an authorship or otherness acknowledged in its classification as material.</div>

    </figure>

<div>A real mountain in the distance is a part of the world in the same way our bodies are a part of the world. Though our existence and the mountain’s share a mutuality, the latter communicates an indifference to us. An observer is not the subject of a far-off mountain, distorting the earth’s curvature, blocking the horizon — one can feel it do these things, one can become it being this way, but it is just as much unperceived.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="131" class="position" href="m.html#131" title="Regarding and demonstrating image-objects’ inherent alterity and containment.">131</a></div>
 <!--reference-->
<div>The image, in contrast, is there for us and it wants to place us at the centre of perception; the perceiving body becomes the centre of a new event. The image generates a subject by virtue of its authorship. This is how Flusser <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Flusser 1983" target="_blank" title="Flusser V (1983/2000) Towards a philosophy of photography">1983/2000</a>:8)</span> saw in the image, ‘a synthesis of two intentions: one manifested in the image and the other belonging to the observer’. The image carries its own intentionality; someone put it there. The viewer or user becomes the witness of something, they are the centre and the object of a process. The image was made to be seen and in as much as we reach out towards images, they reach back and communicate something about us as bodies and the fact that we behold an image.</div> 

	<blockquote><span class="small">
		Vain is the glory of the sky,<br>
		The beauty vain of field and grove,<br>
		Unless, while with admiring eye<br>
		We gaze, we also learn to love.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Wordsworth <a href="5.html#Wordsworth 1845" target="_blank" title="Wordsworth W (1845/2004) Selected poems">1845/2004</a>:186)</span></blockquote>

<div>We are left with a profound image of the beauty of the sky, field, and grove, but, in truth, this image-object, generated through poetry to be aesthetically celebrated, is not real or transcendental. It emerged from the act of reading something that was <em>given</em> by Wordsworth <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Wordsworth 1845" target="_blank" title="Wordsworth W (1845/2004) Selected poems">1845/2004</a>:186)</span>, and any editors who may have contributed to presenting it to the reader. Here, we are describing a feature all images share, their potential to be abstracted as transcendent (not transcendental) authored objects subject to being thought at. Of course, there is a reality to the image but this does not reside where the discourse of aesthetics, philosophy, critical analysis, etc., points to, not the image they analyse. Rather, these modes of thought participate in the performance of the image, as event, as a consequence of their proximity to it. And this participation is necessarily occluded to accomplish their goals. But here we have different goals, in response to what we have discovered in the videogame, and the image we point to and perform in <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>, is not something to think at, come to terms with or act on, rather it is a site or container which can enable new events, an organon which can leverage thought and human expression. Videogames are unique, as images, because they also perform this aspect of images explicitly. The videogame is both a whole, immediately perceived, and yet unfinished, a process that is waiting for us to make happen. This is true of all images, however, the image is accompanied by a mixture of alterity and containment. Alterity, because its mimesis is part of its essence, as an exercise in representation it must always be distinct from the world, or non-world as fiction, it represents. Containment, because, as a target for bodily orientation, though it might claim to represent the whole of human experience or the world — images of the philosophical type — it is encountered by the human within the world — on a screen, piece of paper, etc. So, the performance of this mixture necessarily presupposes an observer; we could also say it creates one.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="132" class="position" href="m.html#132" title="How image-events generate subjective experience.">132</a></div>

<div>In this, we see that the image-event is subjective because it generates a subject. It is an abstract hallucination to regard any image as objective, this includes photographs and digital images generally, and to regard an image as objective is to ignore the process of its emergence <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Flusser <a href="5.html#Flusser 1983" target="_blank" title="Flusser V (1983/2000) Towards a philosophy of photography">1983/2000</a>:15)</span>. Images arrest and impose upon us a particular perspective, notwithstanding different interpretations. These differing interpretations all express the same fundamental orientation towards the image, they presuppose the stance of an interpreter. All interpretations of an image share the spatial alignment necessary to view the thing as an image. Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:226)</span> assertion that all perception is spatial is relevant here. The spatiality we experience in images is only possible as a bodily gesture, for ‘...there would be for me no such thing as space if I did not have a body’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:104)</span>. The image literally puts our bodies in a physical place. We have seen this place transform across mediums as they each introduce a different ‘modality of this [the body’s] anchorage’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Merleau-Ponty <a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:296)</span>, from the painting to the camera with its new forms of resemblance to the cinema (as we have seen in Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement-image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> movement-image) to the videogame image where we enter a new space, uniquely unfolding into a more totalising encompassment of our bodies, of a world, via dialogic inter-human situations, explicit questions awaiting us within the image, i.e. interactivity. The videogame is a new night: ‘The night is not an object in front of me; rather, it envelops me, it penetrates me... it is from within nocturnal space that I unite with it’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Merleau-Ponty <a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:296)</span>. Thus with each new medium we are dealing with radically new bodily situations and new worlds — for ‘we are our world’ and ‘my body is the pivot of the world’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Merleau-Ponty <a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:84, 109)</span>. Thus, the image entails a very specific, embodied and subjective experience, which could be described as a new world, only life is full of new worlds and this is not a specific feature of images. ‘New worlds’ is what the body does; it is constantly generating new worlds. Images can orient the body in such a way that it no longer wants to claim this function for itself. The image-object orientation puts the new world in this local limited finite space to be perceived, inviting a posture where the body is no longer something we perform but something which consumes or receives stimuli — stimuli for subjects to interpret or produce.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="133" class="position" href="m.html#133" title="We adapt to new imaging technologies as novel perceptual postures.">133</a></div>

<div>So when new image technologies emerge, rather than generating novel accurate representations of the world in greater detail, they signify new perceptual situations, new body states, gestures and habits for us to become used to. This is why our initial reactions to new imaging technologies never last. We become practised at getting our grip on the situations until they are seamlessly incorporated into the playspace of our being-in-the-world. Dauthendey <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(cited in Benjamin <a href="5.html#Benjamin 1931" target="_blank" title="Benjamin W (1931/2015) ‘Small history of photography’">1931/2015</a>:69)</span> describes this in relation to people’s first encounters with photographs:</div>

	<blockquote class="small">In the early days, people did not dare to look for very long at the first pictures [Daguerre] produced. They were startled by the vividness of the figures and believed that the tiny little faces of the personages who appeared on the image could see them too. That is how uncanny an effect the unaccustomed vividness and lifelikeness of the first daguerreotype images exerted on everyone.</blockquote>

<div>The novelty of images as new orientations for our bodies is also a source of great appeal.

 <div>Our experience with images can change radically over time, not because some new element of the image is discovered, or greater realism achieved, but because our position in relation to images generally, the habits of our bodies, is constantly changing. In this way, we do not encounter images the same way we encounter other objects in the natural world. An image-event occurs when we contract our being, our body, our capacity for there to be a world, into a single point. We apply that capacity onto a canvas, which is what gives images spatiality. Our world and spatiality are given to the image-event and, in this sense, rather than being a thing in the natural world, we can regard the image to be our body’s performance of a novel event.</div>

Today, the phenomenon of the photograph is unremarkable. The event did not disturb or surprise humans for long and we can attribute this fast habituation to the simplicity of the apparatus producing or preserving the image. As Flusser <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Flusser 1983" target="_blank" title="Flusser V (1983/2000) Towards a philosophy of photography">1983/2000</a>:16)</span> points out, the apparatus of the camera itself indeed harbours some mystery, in this way, the process of generating the photograph can remain hidden, but the photo itself, in one’s hand, is easy to get to the bottom of and see the process by which it is presently manifest. One can fold up a photograph and put it in a pocket and a painting can be comprehended similarly; the brush strokes are visible on close, secondary inspection – the thing has been conquered, there is no further mystery. Notwithstanding this simplicity, the photograph or perspectivism in painting has dramatically altered the way humans understand their place in the world. For example, Flusser <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Flusser 1983" target="_blank" title="Flusser V (1983/2000) Towards a philosophy of photography">1983/2000</a>:19-20)</span> has explored this in relation to history and Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A secular age">2007</a>:144)</span> described perspectivism’s role in the emergence of providential deism. However, it is more difficult to comprehend what we have given to the experience of the monitor or more specifically the videogame to make it possible; we see the pixels, but they keep changing, even in accordance with our bodies as we move the stick on a controller. It is impossible to consistently comprehend the complex origins of the rasterized mountain on a computer screen. This is how, unlike a painting or photograph, we are closed off from the genesis of the hold the rasterized image has on us in the very moment we experience it. The continuous process of the monitor’s cycles and the computer attached to it have become too complex for us to keep track of. In this way, the computer is performing the conditions of the immediately given and our bodies cannot outrun the mystery of the machine. We enter a perception event and elements of that event are ultimately prior to any conscious reflections about it. This is how the digital image can deploy a new <em>a priori</em> with features that demand an explanation. This discourse of explanations, comprehending how the technology works and manipulates our bodies as objects, is an empowering process and part of the technology’s appeal.</div>

<div>There are aspects of the videogame image that do not contribute to the image’s ‘realism’. Rather, these aspects reveal a style, which is tied to how the image was technologically produced. For example, the strangeness of said mountain: the sharp lines and odd lighting which make it distinct from a photograph of a mountain, as well as the flatness, smallness and lack of bodily presence found in most images (virtual reality is an exception). The videogame image is contained in a rectangle that is clearly nested or anchored in the natural world but its distinct style comes from limitations tied to its need to be generated in real time. The image is not just happening to us, we are also happening to the image in the event of gameplay. This unresolved aspect of interactive images has, so far with current technology, necessitated particular styles.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="138" class="position" href="m.html#138" title="Flaws classify images and shape perception.">138</a></div>

<div>These features or ‘flaws’ do not prevent us from experiencing the image as fully as a photorealistic one, but they help us identify the type of image we see, and signal, culturally, how we ought to talk about and judge it. Dwelling on the particularities of a rasterized image, for example, only describes the type of experience we are having and does nothing to weaken the hold the image has on our bodies in that first instance of our perceiving it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="139" class="position" href="m.html#139" title="Our bodies and presuppositions perform an empowerment over the image.">139</a></div>

<div>We experience the image with/as bodies and because our bodies perform a limitless world, the body does not impose limits on the image. After this infinite object, namely the body, is given to generate an experience, thought enters to frame a finite plane separate from our bodies, namely the image. What manifests itself as the distinct style of the videogame in our thinking about it (e.g. broken textures, lighting or artefacts), is a symptom of our performed empowerment and circumscription of the situation. Importantly, this feeling of domination is tied to our active involvement in, and transformation of, the experience of the image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="140" class="position" href="m.html#140" title="Realism judgments do not negate bodily participation.">140</a></div>

<div>Realism, as a value judgement placed on images, comes to bear after the event of initial perception, in the event of further abstractions, explanations, the tracing of the image’s history in relation to its production, etc. We pit this thought exercise against our more fundamental submission to the image, which is our concession in the act of looking at it, we gave it our bodies.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-7" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-7" aria-hidden="true"><sup>7</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-7"> Our first perception of an image is not a hallucination, but the dominance secondary abstractions come to philosophically impose on human experience, and the practice of making those value judgements is hallucinatory.</div></span> The image has a different first instance to a ‘real’ mountain but both are true experiences and not the product of abstract thought.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-8" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-8" aria-hidden="true"><sup>8</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-8"> And abstract thought is also a true experience though not necessarily in the way it assumes itself to be and not in a way that allows it to penetrate and reduce the experience of beholding an image.</div></span> But knowing the image’s reality is different, and analysing the image on those terms according to that difference, does nothing to negate one’s body’s participation in the image-event; philosophers and appraisers of the image, still experience the image because the determined ‘realness’ of it is not what captures us. Many of us enjoy participating in images for the way they are not ‘real’ and the dominating stance this enables us to assume in relation to ‘images’ — more precisely image-events — but this domination happens when we augment the event of perceiving an image with thoughts external to what is necessary for us to participate in it.</div>

<div>We can describe this image as a broken mountain and show how it is undone with the pulling of a thread, leaning in to see the individual pixels or the unrealistic distribution of light. But doing this entails ignoring the image-event and paying no heed to the next instance which always provides a new image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="142" class="position" href="m.html#142" title="Image experiences differ without affecting legitimacy.">142</a></div>

<div>Of course, we never mistake an image for occurrences in the natural world, but again, that is a matter of difference and not legitimacy. We experience images as images in the first instance and are never trapped inside the ‘matrix’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Wachowski and Wachowski <a href="5.html#Wachowski 1999" target="_blank" title="Wachowski L and Wachowski L (directors) (1999) The matrix [motion picture]">1999</a>)</span>. The experience’s status as image and the conditions of its production are presupposed and understood in the act of directing our bodies towards it. But these very thoughts and the framing of an image as an object, these preceding contextualisations are present before the image is consumed in the same way subsequent abstractions are. The experience of the image, the real image-event in its radically immanent and immediate form, these questions of ‘realism’ and Cartesian <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Descrates <a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:22)</span> nightmares cannot be present, there is no room for them, they are incomprehensible.

This did not happen because I had mistaken the ‘real’ dumpster near my house for the image of a dumpster in the videogame.

The realness of the image does not factor in my participation in the image while playing the videogame, so nothing was preventing me from making the same association in the natural world. Upon reflection (the addition of thought) the experiences are very different but this is what made the episode so amusing — I had no intention of hiding myself or unconscious/dead Russian soldiers in the dumpster near my house.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="143" class="position" href="m.html#143" title="Emancipation recognizes our optional role and image self-sufficiency.">143</a></div>

<div>Our default mode for thinking and talking about images unnecessarily assumes a stance of domination over the image (and therefore the event) in question. This includes aesthetic discussions grounded in any medium whatever but also videogames, particularly criticisms pertaining to the trajectory of videogame graphics towards photorealism. Consider the latter: the appraisal of videogame graphics necessarily construes the videogame image as an illusion, and this illusion is rationalised away in the assumption of a posture that can assess it. This posture is incapable of acknowledging the pre-reflective space that is the contribution of our bodies to the event. We ignore what the image-event is doing to our bodies, how it is orienting us and what we are contributing to that event and, rather, focus on the image as an object that is seeking to align with the natural world. When the videogame image is judged in this way, it ceases to be a dialogic image, an unresolved event to which we, as performing bodies, perform or contribute. In this mode, the true videogame image is hidden from us. We are unaware of our participation in the image-event, we naively construct, we auto-position, an image-object. Rancière’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rancière 2011" target="_blank" title="Rancière J (2011) The emancipated spectator">2011</a>:13)</span> emancipated spectators recognise the role they play in the transpiring event, they ‘challenge the opposition between viewing and acting’. But an emancipation specific to the videogame can be found in acknowledging the contribution of our gaze as only an occasional or optional contribution, altogether unnecessary, so that the dialogic videogame event is sufficient without it — and without it we always think closer to it. As we have seen, there is a necessary mutuality to the production of a videogame image, but nothing in the event depends on it being framed as an image via the assumption of a position external to it.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-9" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-9" aria-hidden="true"><sup>9</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-9"> This is because the act of playing a videogame presupposes our accepting that the image is ‘determined-in-the-last-instance’ (see Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:125).</div></span> The generation of an image-object is non-essential to the videogame.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="144" class="position" href="m.html#144" title="Videogames feel limitless through the body’s infinity.">144</a></div>
	
<div>The body can be seen as essential but only as the pre-reflective <em>situation</em> offered up to the production of an image-event, not the body as an object to be acted on. This situation has been occluded from our understanding of videogames. Evidence of our bodies within the image can be found in the infinity we feel while playing a game. A <em>Street Fighter</em> match has obvious parameters, as is explained at <a title="Street Fighter limits space and time for player agency." target="_blank" href="#069">069</a>, and these parameters are necessary to produce creative dialogic responses to emerging situations. But again, these are to be regarded as questions (<a title="Street Fighter is a dialogic event." target="_blank" href="#089">089</a>), not limitations. The experience of a videogame itself has no limits, only bad development choices, and when we encounter these we blame the developer. The screen has a finite resolution and the computer has finite memory, from whence to attribute the open and inexhaustible nature of our experience with a videogame? We do so in the same way Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:94)</span> identified infinity in the experience of having a body, as the source ‘by which there are objects’. The infinity that we give the image is there by virtue of the body, as transcendental situation, which is our need to perform an occurrence as a porous body, as our situation ‘in’ the world, in order to experience it.</div> 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="145" class="position" href="m.html#145" title="Real experience surpasses abstract thought, revealing image-events via performance.">145</a></div>

<div>Any exercise of power over an image-event, as image-object, as we have described, is a colonisation of the human, in that it contributes towards a totalising comprehension of the experience of having a body. However, this power only resides and can only be exercised within the hallucinatory mode that produced it. Abstract, theoretical encompassment can only happen after the image has already been perceived, and because each consecutive moment gives us a new potential image-object, this style of thought finds itself being constantly overtaken by real human experience. For, performing the videogame, all philosophical or critical augmentations to the event, because of what they target, the material they need to function, they cannot express the image-event within their forms of practice. The image-event is only revealed on its terms according to how it is performed and is its own representation.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="146" class="position" href="m.html#146" title="While the philosopher needs an interlocutor, they miss the lived embodied event.">146</a></a></div>

<div>The above descriptions of the role of the body, as situation, in the image-event that is a videogame is not an obvious one, even for phenomenologists, notwithstanding the role Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span> work played in inspiring it — and we will not let that constrain what we do with it. We see this in how the phenomenological tradition has been applied to digital media more generally. It has been made clear above, using Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:355)</span>, that we participate in the experience of the image by incorporating it into the experience of our bodies; ‘the body is the situation’. In the same way, perception is never isolated to a single sensory organ, the entire body is geared towards phenomena by becoming an event with it. When discussing computers, there is a tendency to exclude the body from an analysis of what is transpiring on the screen. Dreyfus <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dreyfus 2009" target="_blank" title="Dreyfus HL (2009) On the internet">2009</a>)</span> famously employed Heideggerian philosophy to critique artificial intelligence and the internet, but this was mostly to bring two different understandings of reality up against each other. In this way, Dreyfus’ work, importantly, has thrown into relief assumptions about human intelligence and the world, tied to a rationalism that is foundational to the development of new technologies. But the development of artificial intelligence is not a phenomenological issue. To make it so, we must contextualise it as a manifestation of the philosophical traditions phenomenology was a reaction against – the philosopher needs an interlocutor.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="147" class="position" href="m.html#147" title="Philosophers assume a posture towards the videogame image.">147</a></div>

<div>A philosopher could do the same thing with the videogame image, framing its pursuit of graphical realism as philosophical demonstration; it has conquered perception with pure maths and physics and — to use Wittgenstein’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Wittgenstein 1953" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein (1953/2009) Philosophical investigations">1953/2009</a>:53e)</span> phrase — ‘a picture held us captive’. The popularity of simulation arguments based on projections of a virtual world indistinguishable from reality demonstrates the potency of this image and makes this association easy. Once this framing is set, computer-generated images can be critiqued with any philosophy critical of Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span>, especially Heideggerian existentialism or phenomenology.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="148" class="position" href="m.html#148" title="A style of thought belonging to the videogame is non-philosophical.">148</a></div>

<div>A philosophical critique can detract from the value of the digital world, as Dreyfus <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dreyfus 2009" target="_blank" title="Dreyfus HL (2009) On the internet">2009</a>)</span> has shown, and one can use Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span> to vouch for the primacy of the body in these times of digital selves. These are the obvious philosophical paths to take in response to what recent technologies are accomplishing, to regard and respond to them as philosophical demonstrations of rationalist ideas. But this does nothing to think along with the event as a situated phenomenon. We have been preparing a view of the videogame image in which the normative discourse of ‘computer graphics’ is made subordinate, as incidental interior element, to the image-event itself. The posture we assume while playing a videogame, which is the phenomena’s invitation to us, is non-philosophical. We have <em>discovered</em> this through participation in the lived event and through a determination to make space for it, to uncover a style of thought belonging to the videogame. This is opposed to the generation of a philosophical interlocutor via a hidden decision to account for everything.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="149" class="position" href="m.html#149" title="We can give the videogame a new anthropological image.">149</a></div>

<div>So rather than a philosophical engagement that <em>happens to</em> the videogame, we can give the videogame a <em>new anthropological image</em>. ‘New’, because it is emerging, interactive and unfinished like the videogame; ‘anthropological’ for its capacity to be non-philosophical like the videogame; ‘image’, to subvert the term while extending the practice’s application to all image-events. This new location for philosophical discourse within our image of the experience of an image liberates the videogame as human practice. Any limitations placed on the videogame image are additions that distance us from the initial human dialogic experience. The site of the image-event is a finite object and the image on our screen has a very specific and limited intentionality, as something which is authored, but these features are not experienced as limitations on the level of interactivity, which is how we think according to, and along with, the videogame as we perform it. There, we become the image. It is not something to think about philosophically, but something to participate in, and the most we can do is observe that participation by taking it up as new practice.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="150" class="position" href="m.html#150" title="Both computer graphics and philosophical discourse are potential material for the image-event.">150</a></div>

<div>With both computer graphics and philosophical discourse positioned as material or ‘content’ for the image-event, the videogame becomes a unidirectional gesture of faith towards an open image, which is a world. All postures, philosophical or otherwise, presuppose the videogame as a world. At <a title="Rasterisation is described on a monitor." target="_blank" href="#116">116</a>, we considered how the rasterized videogame image’s eccentricities invite an unveiling, that is, a critique or contemplation or simple awareness of the image’s history and how it was produced. But an unlimited, perceived world at the site of the image is presupposed for this to occur. Not a fictional world, but an infinite plane of intellectual and bodily activity. This mode stops explicitly ‘believing’ in the image-event as a world, as an inexhaustible site for human expression, to instead have faith in its ability to disassemble an image-object. But to play a videogame, one has faith in the inter-human event itself. The parameters of the body, the difference between oneself and the image, are not drawn here, for the body is surrendered over to that event. Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:5)</span> regards perception to be an expression of primordial belief, that is, a faith or expectation in the world prior to thought. The baby extends their arm to grasp the object, not because their brain harbours some pre-configured map of the world, and neither is it the event of imagination based on <em>a priori</em> categories <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kant <a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>)</span>, but it is based on a kind of impulsive faith, not in anything specific, just in the fact that there is anything at all. A videogame is an image that entails this same unlimited gesture, but which no longer imposes on itself the status: <em>representation</em> (unlike other forms of the image).</div>

<div>And to express an image of the videogame that is not an amphibology, an image that the videogame’s very nature does not contradict, means generating an open image. Any successful image of the videogame must be open in the same way a videogame is. That is, it must be an image which makes explicit the requirement to make both space for ourselves in its event and space for that event within us, to happen to us. Thus, we draw attention to the means of image production in a way that pertains to <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> itself, so that we are describing the conditions of experience while leaving the final experience itself in the hands of the reader/player.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-10" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-10" aria-hidden="true"><sup>10</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-10"> And we do this in a way that is neither empirical, nor philosophical, so there is no claim to circle back and close off the image with a philosophical decision, with a hallucinated penetration of the real (see Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>).</div></span> A transcendental image is performed, which is not a label to apply to certain cases, but a posture we can assume in relation to any image.</div>

<div>Again: What makes the videogame image transcendentally distinct from other dialogic events? We are not suggesting that the videogame image is unique as dialogue because, of course, dialogue is everywhere. Another way to elucidate the videogame’s transcendental distinctness goes like this: the posture we assume and the world we express faith in, in videogames, is bracketed out. Other forms of media and dialogue act on ‘this world’, one reads a book, talks to a person, etc. But action in videogames always transpires on the level of a further abstraction. We are not referring to the fictional worlds of videogame stories — the difference between diegetic and non-diegetic <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Galloway <a href="5.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:22)</span>  instances do not matter here — The United States of America acted on in Death Stranding <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kojima <a href="5.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>)</span>, is different to the USA in the perceived world, not because the former is fictional but because the former is acted on <em>as an image</em>. The videogame, to play it, must be acted on as a second-order world, with this aforementioned transcendental posture and thus as a transcendental image. Of course, one does not need to be aware of any of this at all to play a videogame, and the present discoveries of our explorations of the videogame image could be described now as an unlearning; the experience of a videogame is teaching us to shed certain habits of thought.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="153" class="position" href="m.html#153" title="Surrender to the image-event and adopt a new posture.">153</a></div>

<!-- link the uneven power distribution to the temporal difference mentioned much earlier -->
<div>Pursuing the videogame image in a way that is loyal to the phenomenon, over research questions or disciplinary customs, means surrendering expectations fully so that the videogame can happen to us. What about the uneven power distribution inherent in the second-order world of a videogame? The player must submit to the parameters of a world already prepared by the developer/s. A concern like this generates a comparison between the different sites of potential action, in a register completely foreign to the experience of a videogame, ignoring the dialogic in-between-ness. We do not dismiss this and similar issues lightly when choosing to stay on target, which is the image-event itself, not reflections that only become possible before or after that event. The videogame is demanding of us an image that is not philosophical, sociological or anthropological, but because it is a human practice, a lived human image-event, we will preserve the last term, modified with the classification ‘new’, to distinguish it from other anthropologies which look passed the videogame image and have their own agendas, not to evoke notions of progressivism but to distinguish it from a closed image, it is always a ‘new’ image. So, ‘new anthropological image’, is another way of assuming the posture necessary to play a videogame, allowing it to extend beyond the videogame, especially into the next anthropology we perform. It is another way of assuming a transcendental image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="154" class="position" href="m.html#154" title="A human event which defies technological and philosophical encompassment.">154</a></div>

<!-- change ‘on the next page’ to the paragraph number; also explain how we will do what this pragraph is suggesting by returning once again to the reoccurring theme of computer graphics -->
<div>These ideas, which we have seen emerge through a framing of the videogame image as radically immanent, have implications for how we regard the screen, computer, etc. — any non-human apparatus which contributes to the dialogic image and any technologies or imaging techniques associated with them. Commencing thought from the human event of gameplay and preceding outwards, devices and imaging techniques like ray tracing or rasterisation, ‘contribute’ to the image-event but are no longer separate from the event in a causal chain. In this way, imaging techniques and devices lose their philosophical capital as achievements in portrayals of realism. This new mode will now be explored; we will pragmatically expound a novel way of talking about these technologies which does not reduce the videogame image to a mere philosophical demonstration. We will suspend considerations of our experience with the second-order world of the image, to identify our radically immanent relationship with the device and its movements, before exploring what these are doing to how we experience our bodies and the world in the context of violence. Note that this is all in the service of a conveyance of the triumph of the videogame image, as a human event that cannot be technologically or philosophically encompassed, despite how we are in the habit of talking and thinking about it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="156" class="position" href="m.html#156" title="Popular discourse frames the body and event as subordinate.">156</a></div>

<div>We will describe the qualitative difference in computer graphics, as they have evolved, as per the style we have been developing over the previous sections, in a way that is <em>not</em> according to new accomplishments in the conveyance of realism to represent the natural world. Innovations relevant to videogame consumer discourse, that is the videogame as fetish, commodity, latest graphics card, gaming console, etc., are marketed and celebrated as ‘immersive realism’, though this is described in disparate ways — recall Kasavin’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kasavin 1997" target="_blank" title="Kasavin G (1997) Final fantasy VII review">1997</a>:para.2)</span> description of <em>Final Fantasy VII’s</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kitase <a href="5.html#Kitase 1997" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (1997) Final fantasy vii [videogame]">1997</a>)</span> graphics at <a title="‘...the strikingly realistic world of Final Fantasy VII, both beautiful in its grandeur and terrifying in its detail’." target="_blank" href="#134">134</a>. All these efforts frame the human body as subordinate to the technology it is surrendered over to — the body as something which can ‘be immersed’ via the reproduction of lines and styles it recognises from the natural world but generated via completely different means; the body is deceived. So, what is really being fetishised here is the opportunity, or function which allows us, users, to give more of our bodies – more of what is pre-reflective – to the event of image production. Popular discourse around videogames predisposes us to applaud such disempowerment, for the sake of ‘escapism’, ‘immersion’, ‘meaning’ in this image we are willing to surrender ourselves over to.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="157" class="position" href="m.html#157" title="But this only happens while we think in those terms.">157</a></div>

<div><em>But all this only happens when we think the image in those terms.</em> These devices and methods — human works, practices and artefacts that are essential to the videogame image — are being developed and deployed as responses to, and expressions of, a discourse that disempowers and reduces the human. For us, however, intent on regarding the videogame image <em>itself</em>, these aspects of the experience do <em>not</em> make the image more closely resemble ‘real life’. These technologies and devices are symptoms of an attempt to redistribute the economy of the image, as a discrete object, as a philosophical or technological image, not a transcendental image. They are symptoms of a philosophical framing that leverages the image to colonise the perceiving human body. This discourse and value system distracts us from the real event while attracting us along lines anticipated and external to it, namely a technological progressivism. Methods like rasterisation and ray tracing are inter-human techniques in which the videogame image is misplaced, for it is read and interpreted outside the videogame event because the human is framed as a perceiving object, which has been overcome by the spectacle of the technology.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="158" class="position" href="m.html#158" title="Questions of realism hallucinate an application to the image-event.">158</a></div>

<div>To preserve the image of the videogame image we have been developing, we will need to dispense with the familiar narratives and even take these narratives as indications of what to avoid; we will employ them to serve a negative function. For example: Is not the above difference in realism self-evident? It is only self-evident to one who holds technological progressivism and philosophical ambition as a presupposition and style of thought. Both images, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid IV</em>, are equally real and unreal, for this entirely depends on the posture we bring to our assessment of the image and all questions of realism can be described as ‘external’, or occasional, applications or augmentations <em>to</em> the image-event — though this externality is a hallucination.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="159" class="position" href="m.html#159" title="Technological developments do not contribute more to the image-event.">159</a></div>

<div>But one does not need to hold these beliefs to experience the sum of these developments as mere difference. Many changes entail the device forming more closely with our bodies. This is manifest in the increasing screen size, decreasing thickness and disappearing bezels we are all familiar with in our phones, computers and televisions. The image comes to occupy more physical space in relation to our bodies. The parts of the device that could interrupt ‘immersion’ by inspiring an ‘external’ interpretation of the image via a competing philosophical stance in which the human is not overcome, like a physicalism that occludes the image-event entirely, become smaller and smaller until these disturbing parts which could pull us out of image participation have disappeared. Here is a point so painfully obvious that it ought not to need mentioning: it is a point anyone who has read a good novel or watched a classic black and white film, or played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kitase and Ito <a href="5.html#Kitase 1994" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y and Ito H (directors) (1994) Final fantasy vi [videogame]">1994</a>)</span> after playing <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> already knows: these technological developments do not enable us to contribute more or derive more meaning from, the image-event and, if anything, they can get in the way. Having made that point, we will maintain a posture of indifference and interpret recent graphics as merely a different style in how some elements of the image are being performed by certain actors.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="160" class="position" href="m.html#160" title="Consider the CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor.">160</a></div>

<div>To practice thinking image styles as mere difference, consider the image as an embodied event without boundaries. Think the image-event in a way that is not limited to what is displayed on the screen, in a way that extends ‘beyond’ the screen. Consider the CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor in my shed...</div>

<div>The CRT works by firing electrons from a cathode at the back of the monitor to a phosphorescent screen at the front. These types of monitors are old, heavy and take up a lot of desk space – they are large because the electrons need to travel a distance to create the image. They were expensive to make and are difficult and potentially dangerous to dispose of. I found my first CRT monitor, a ViewSonic E70, dumped on the side of the road covered in mud. After bringing it home and discovering that it still worked, I put it on the desk in my office, right next to a 4k Samsung LCD.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-11" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-11" aria-hidden="true"><sup>11</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-11"> I have since safely disposed of the ViewSonic because it stopped working.

<div>There is an irreducible difference between the experience of each of these display technologies. The fact of the object and its relation to my body is present in the immediate, lived, image-event. For, the parameters of the lived human event of the image are not limited to the rectangle of the screen. ‘Immanent’ does not localise our interest to only the screen itself or what we can see there. As an event, the videogame image cannot be understood within any parameters. So, our understanding of our participation in the image must abandon these rectangular limits of the screen, as Bergson <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and memory">1896/2004</a>:337; <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> has already shown us. We allow the constituents of the image-event to overtake our discourse, so they are couched in the real and are more than what we can account for. In one sense, we have mobilised our discussion to extend ‘beyond’ pure image quality or immersive realism, so that the image-event encompasses all aspects to do with one’s body, its position relative to a device and everything else, as well as the ideas, the philosophies of the image at <a title="The philosopher needs an interlocutor." target="_blank" href="#146">146</a>, in what they have to do with one’s posture and lived immanent experience of the image.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-12" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-12" aria-hidden="true"><sup>12</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-12"> So that all these phenomena are more than ‘relevant’ to the image but are indistinguishable constituents of the image-event as it is determined-in-the-last-instance. To any history of the image, any discourse or technology anticipating the image in a causal chain we apply Laruelle’s (<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:177) description of ‘... the phenomenon in its identity, the <em>phenomenon as real past</em> “within” and “from” which we can think’.</div></span> So there is really no ‘beyond’ or transcendence from the radically immanent image-event itself. Rather, it is lived. Thus, a transcendental image is evoked.</div>

		<h3 align="center">Presenting the CRT image as Difference</h3>
		<div>The CRT image is experienced and lived in a way that is fundamentally different from the LCD image and there are some technical reasons for this, which we can now elucidate.</div>
		<br>
		<div>Many passionate online communities who prefer CRTs express their preferences on the grounds of image quality alone. The CRT has certain inherent features which LCD manufacturers still often struggle to achieve. CRTs can have a higher perceived dynamic range; colours are richer and potentially more accurate; because CRTs have no set number of pixels, they can scale to a larger variety of resolutions and do so natively; images are softer, but this also means lower resolutions look better; most of all, because the image is formed by an electron beam rapidly scanning a phosphorescent screen, entire frames cannot bleed into each other, there is no pixel response time, therefore motion clarity is perfect. Recent LCD technology called ‘black frame insertion’ or ‘back-light strobing’, attempts to recreate this effect in LCDs, often at the cost of reduced brightness. Of course, nostalgia plays a role in CRT’s appeal today too, especially for playing retro PC games.</div>
		<br>
		<div>The CRT, as an artefact today, offers us the participation in a different philosophical stance because we are reversing technology’s ‘progress’, reducing the image. Its size is smaller with less overall clarity. The apparatus does not form to the shape of the body, but one is forced to navigate and compensate for it with one’s body. This all allows us to see the qualitative difference in image style as it affects the image-event. The CRT-image is grounded in a weighted physicality, there is depth to it that aligns with the depth of the machine itself. ‘It looks like you’re looking through a lens, like a piece of glass instead of a digital display’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Linneman <a href="5.html#Linneman 2019" target="_blank" title="Linneman J (December 7 2019) ‘DF direct: CRT displays - was LCD a big mistake for gaming?’ [video]">2019</a>:5’28”)</span> and more than that, in a way that feels like you are looking into another world. The rounded glass at the front of the device is looked through into a beyond that has physical presence and which is unknown, lending mystery to the image. The size and weight of the monitor manifest themselves in one’s immediate perception of the image being produced; the electrons fired from the cathode pass through a physically hidden cavity, which our bodies enter into a relation with. What is a nihilism in the flat Samsung panel, seeking to conceal all its inner workings in order to give our bodies an isolated image, becomes mystery that has meaning in the CRT for the body and its relation to the world.</div>
		<br>
		<div>Thus we can think against the direction of technological development, against the removal of meaning from the embodied experience of the image. We can recontextualise perception, via different situations inspiring different orientations to the image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="164" class="position" href="m.html#164" title="Display difference as material for a transcendental image.">164</a></div>

<div>We can now leverage the difference itself, described in ‘Presenting the CRT image as Difference’, not for the sake of its usual application to serve a deconstruction of the image, or images of technological progressivism, but as a symptom of an image-event. By doing this, we can generate a transcendental image that is independent of philosophical or technological interpretations (images) of the image. Like this: say these technologies (CRT, LCD, OLED, etc.) are aspects of the image which can invite different philosophical or scientific postures, then declare all postures which do not entail playing the videogame to be insufficient. Further, declare those postures to be potential constituents of the image-event itself. Thus, none of these features of the image are excluded from the image-event, the image-event is not ‘reframed’ away from these concerns which, of course, are still present in the experience. Rather, the image-event is <em>unframed</em> so that we live the image. Take ‘Presenting the CRT as Difference’ to be an image itself, presented above because the CRT constitutes a different lived event than we are used to, it can inspire a different way of thinking with the image, we then take that difference and say it has not escaped the image-event. Again, put another way: above we used the CRT to perform a deconstruction, in order to forsake it, to declare it insufficient, to apply that insufficiency to all philosophies of the image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="165" class="position" href="m.html#165" title="A transcendental image-event includes various interpretations as mere material.">165</a></div>

<div>The CRT and LCD are both potential elements of the image-event and above we have presented different ways of understanding or interpreting their contribution to that event. While it is true that this practice evinces our intellectual misplacement and reduction of the videogame image, as a transcendent image, and much effort has been expelled above to demonstrate this point, <em>it is also true that these interpretations themselves are potential constituents of the image-event</em>. The LCD does more to frame the image as an object, thus concealing the image-event from our discourse only, not lived experience.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-13" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-13" aria-hidden="true"><sup>13</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-13"> Moves towards immersive realism, of which virtual reality is the apex, do nothing to prevent the event itself but are rather more hallucinatory in the same way Laruelle (<a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:106) describes philosophy to be hallucinatory and not according to the escapism fetishised in technological progressivism’s aspirations towards immersive realism.</div></span> Because the CRT can inspire us to think in the opposite direction, and our bodies’ relation to the image is made explicit immediately in our performance of / participation in the generation of the image, this can leverage our assumption of a new posture where the image is no longer an object but rather an event we are a part of. And for the image to be transcendental we go further still, so that the image-event, as real, is not even circumscribed as event, so that the least deluded posture of image participation to assume is no longer concerned with delusion, no longer rejecting emerging philosophies of the image but rather takes them as mere material of this occasional (new) image one happens to perform.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="166" class="position" href="m.html#166" title="MAP">166</a></div>

<div>Now we are in a position to play this image-event, <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>, particularly this current second page, as not only transcendental but a videogame image itself. This has been made possible through the subsequent performance of framing the videogame image as transcendental. This performance, as material, can at present be discussed to further reveal the posture we have assumed, allowing this occasion to be affected by its own discoveries and what was required to discover them. That is, we are ready to further develop this style of thought, inspired by the videogame, in which we are no longer concerned with <em>representing</em> the videogame or reducing it into an inferior mode. Instead, we seek to discover new ways of performing the videogame image, allowing <em>this</em> to be a videogame image in its own unique performance.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="167" class="position" href="m.html#167" title="MAP">167</a></div>

<div><a href="2.html" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE AS TRANSCENDENTAL" target="_blank">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a> starts from paragraph <a title="We use cinema to start thinking about videogames." target="_blank" href="#049">049’s</a> position, which concedes the cinema as a theme for the sake of its familiarity, and to anticipate the impending Deleuzian associations of <a title="Cinema generates real movement by mobilising sets." target="_blank" href="#056">056</a> and beyond. Our first task is to liberate the videogame from this association, to frame the phenomenon as its own new form of human event. Many images can be evoked to accomplish this, but  Deleuze’s movement-image is chosen to serve a negative function, to demonstrate its incompatibility with reference to <em>Street Fighter</em>. <a title="Cinema generates real movement by mobilising sets." target="_blank" href="#056">056</a>-<a title="The movement-image was absent from early cinema." target="_blank" href="#063">063</a> all together produce, through Deleuze and Bergson, an image of real movement according to the cinema, the movement-image, which <a title="Montage makes gameplay difficult." target="_blank" href="#064">064</a> can then use to contradict the continuous shots necessary for most videogames. <em>Street Fighter</em> is taken by <a title="Contra Deleuze’s cinema, Street Fighter performs illusions of movement." target="_blank" href="#067">067</a> as the ultimate expression of the videogame’s contradiction, and this incompatibility with Deleuze is pursued until <a title="The videogame invites us to assume a new posture." target="_blank" href="#110">110</a> finally generates a culminating image of the videogame as distinct inter-human event. <a title="Definitions can limit our engagement." target="_blank" href="#071">071</a>-<a title="The cinematographic illusion is mobile in videogames." target="_blank" href="#080">080</a> and <a title="Animation is a means of collaborative image production." target="_blank" href="#103">103</a>-<a title="Animation is a ‘caricature’ of movement." target="_blank" href="#107">107</a> are responsible for two substantial digressions regarding the definition of videogames and animation respectively.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="168" class="position" href="m.html#168" title="MAP">168</a></div>

All of these paragraphs — save the digressions which could be described as supplementary — sought or discovered the videogame as distinct phenomena, which could be made subject to, penetrated by, the exercise of various thought practices. This is regardless of the source of the concepts employed, be it philosophy, in the case of Deleuze, or <em>Street Fighter</em>. <a title="Street Fighter’s real movement was discovered in a different mode." target="_blank" href="#108">108</a> framed gameplay, interactivity, and dialogue as essential to the videogame event, and player agency was taken ‘to be the fundamental gesture of interactive media’. For our new posture to be maintained, we will not even allow those framings to encompass the phenomena but will leave the videogame un-circumscribed. We achieve this not by contradicting <a title="Street Fighter’s real movement was discovered in a different mode." target="_blank" href="#108">108</a>, so as to assume an opposing philosophical position, but by validating <a title="‘’." target="_blank" href="#108">108</a> as a legitimate circumstantial response according to its image-event.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="169" class="position" href="m.html#169" title="MAP">169</a></div>

<div><a title="We anticipate a trajectory into the transcendental image." target="_blank" href="#111">111</a> shifts concern away from the image-event of gameplay and dialogue previously established, and this is to frame a new image-object in display technologies. For, framing the event of gameplay as a non-object creates an analytical vacuum, so <a title="We anticipate a trajectory into the transcendental image." target="_blank" href="#111">111</a> grasps for a new aspect of the videogame to ‘figure out’, i.e. it discovers or generates ‘a new location for the image-object after the discovery of the image-event’. This is a natural response to all previous positions of <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> because thought is in the habit of finding an object to think at — it needs a new task.</div>

<div>The trajectory commenced by <a title="We anticipate a trajectory into the transcendental image." target="_blank" href="#111">111</a> is also a response to the videogame’s ‘implicit challenge’ to any framing of it as an object, identified at <a title="The videogame invites us to assume a new posture." target="_blank" href="#110">110</a>: so be it, the videogame image is not an object, but let us pursue the most counterintuitive site for such a claim, namely computer graphics, to see if we cannot generate a justifiable object which can be subject to our thinking.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="171" class="position" href="m.html#171" title="MAP">171</a></div> 

<div>Yet this gesture is immediately betrayed by its own process, by the positions which emerge from its new goal, which use Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span> to undo the perceived ‘object’ more generally in a way that extends to computer graphics, all while pushing the transcendental concept into new modes. As transcendental postures are encountered throughout the process of representing the videogame — or representing the videogame’s representational aspects — the image-object gets levelled to the status of material or non-essential content of the videogame event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="172" class="position" href="m.html#172" title="MAP">172</a></div> 

<div><a title="The image is transcendental as condition of experience." target="_blank" href="#120">120</a> evokes the concept of transcendental in a familiar Kantian style where the image is a condition of experience. But <a title="The videogame image is always new." target="_blank" href="#121">121</a> places this image, as condition of experience, not in the structures of cognition that our mind brings to bear on experience (which is the Kantian mode), but rather in the experience of perceiving the image itself (following Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span>).</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="173" class="position" href="m.html#173" title="MAP">173</a></div>

<div>So from these two positions, <a title="The image is transcendental as condition of experience." target="_blank" href="#120">120</a> and <a title="The videogame image is always new." target="_blank" href="#121">121</a>, we see a shift in the location of the transcendental, away from the internal and static categories of the understanding and forms of intuition, and towards a grounding in the experience of perception or the means of perception, namely the body. The upshot of this shift, this new transcendental posture, is the undoing of the perceived <em>object</em> <a title="‘’." target="_blank" href="#111">111</a> might have had plans to think at, and its absorption into the immanent experienced videogame <em>event</em>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="174" class="position" href="m.html#174" title="MAP">174</a></div>

<div><a title="The videogame image is always new." target="_blank" href="#121">121</a> also frames the videogame image, as a result of its new transcendental status, as <em>new</em>, which makes space for an eventual Laruellian daulisis where the image is ‘determined-in-the-last-instance’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span>. Broader contextualisations only contradict this description of the image while they are held separate from the event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="175" class="position" href="m.html#175" title="MAP">175</a></div> 

<div><a title="The image is transcendental notwithstanding contextualisations." target="_blank" href="#122">122</a> begins to acknowledge this by holding ‘contextualisations as symptoms of a posture’ but quickly brings the emphasis back to the flow state of immersive gameplay as more legitimate or more aligned with what the event is predisposed to become. So here, discourse of the image is not yet fully subsumed into the event, we do not yet regard a unified phenomena where the videogame and our current practice, namely talking about the videogame, can be simultaneously regarded in a ‘vision-in-one’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="176" class="position" href="m.html#176" title="MAP">176</a></div> 

<div>But the need for this vision and a striving for it continues to arise: at <a title="The transcendental status is not undermined by history." target="_blank" href="#127">127</a>, so that the transcendental image is causally uncoupled from descriptions of an image’s origins, at <a title="Images are transcendental with distinct postures." target="_blank" href="#129">129</a>, so that an event’s pre-reflective categorisation as ‘image’ is revealed to be an aspect of its performance and at <a title="Open this image to generate a transcendental posture." target="_blank" href="#163">163</a>, so that <em>this</em> text is performatively equated with previously captured videogame footage, it does not surpass it with a capacity to better describe or understand the phenomena but is rather an instance of the phenomena.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="177" class="position" href="m.html#177" title="MAP">177</a></div>

<div>The gesture of <a title="Open this image to generate a transcendental posture." target="_blank" href="#163">163</a> reaches the vision, but the problem of how to proceed from there remains. In an attempt to address this, <a title="Display difference as material for a transcendental image." target="_blank" href="#164">164</a> aligns with the theme of display technologies and reframes the challenges of realism and immersion, positioning them as aspects of the event rather than objects of striving. This approach is embodied in <a title="Display difference as material for a transcendental image." target="_blank" href="#164">164</a>’s description of the CRT image-event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="178" class="position" href="m.html#178" title="MAP">178</a></div> 

<div>Thus, <a title="A transcendental image-event includes interpretations as material." target="_blank" href="#165">165</a> regards the transcendental image-event as a phenomenon that includes interpretations <em>of</em> it as potential constituents of it. So, we are no longer resisting the notion of an image-object, but take the image-object as a feature of performance. We assume a posture that does not reject representation, for we represent things because of the radically immanent situation, determined in the last instance, not for a supposed circumscription of the real. <em>This is how we play videogames.</em></div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="179" class="position" href="m.html#179" title="MAP">179</a></div>

<div>If we accept what the videogame never ceases to demonstrate — that is, as an image, it is its own best representation of itself — rather than using that to generate a space for simplicity or inaccessibility within a new philosophy of videogames (which is really a reduction and a dismissal of the event), we can actually follow through and receive what is discovered in the videogame itself as an invitation. This is not to capture the videogame event, but rather to generate a new image-event of our own. <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> commenced in pursuit of conclusions, these were encountered early for they are easy to find, but the videogame demands more from us, namely the dispensing of conclusions in favour of a new image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="180" class="position" href="m.html#180" title="MAP">180</a></div> 

<div>The videogame is not essential to this posture but our particular style and our discovery of it on this occasion is thanks to the videogame. This not only refers to how the image is played and interacted with in a way that conveys some semblance of videogames but the movements of ideas. This videogame style of thought does not entail the distanced deployment of concepts from an external relativism, because each position — as they were represented by <a title="Positions to separate the videogame image from cinema." target="_blank" href="#167">167</a>-<a title="165 no longer resisting the notion of an image-object." target="_blank" href="#178">178</a> — involves an actioning commitment and situational belief in the occasion of the movement; each force (of) thought can be locally legitimised by its circumstance, its truth can be measured according to its role in the performance of thought. Videogames also entail and enjoy this kind of ‘relative autonomy’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>)</span>; each videogame runs according to its own rules and the value of gestures is determined via the presupposition of those rules — as we have seen in <em>Street Fighter</em>. Videogames can be playful in this way because no one takes them seriously, <em>which in no way undermines the meaningfulness and gravity of their contributions to thought and human experience</em>. So philosophy and anthropology, and any thought striving for sophistication, deepness and a usefulness as representation, notwithstanding some historical hubristic baggage and ambition, can enjoy a relative autonomy in the same way videogames do if we take them all less seriously. This increased levity would mean, we do not give those thought practices power over us, we do not let them determine us or our performance of them, or determine our creative response to the experience of them, but let us determine them unidirectionally, as we find ourselves determined in the last instance according to the real.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="181" class="position" href="m.html#181" title="MAP">181</a></div> 

<div>We perform this project as a videogame, as it appears, as it is played, as it is felt and experienced with our bodies, in our lounge rooms, on the CRT I found by the side of the road, in my analysis of that experience, during the fact and after the fact, in a new image where the original is not only historically referred to but is equally part of this new image, determined in the last instance. We can put these aspects, including the videogame and whatever forces moved me to pursue it as a research topic, in the immediate lived event, but not as context. And the event is not derivative or dependent on such elements, rather, they come out of the image-event, as real, as irreducible unframed human event. This is the posture one assumes to play a videogame, which is a transcendental image.</div>
