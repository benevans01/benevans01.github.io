<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="182" class="position" href="m.html#182" title="Rosenzweig critiques philosophy’s neglect of death.">182</a></div>
		
<div>Rosenzweig’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> magnum opus, <em>The Star of Redemption</em>, opens with a critique of Western philosophy’s efforts to transcend death. He argues that philosophical systems like Hegel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span> fail to account for an individual’s fear of mortality, such singularities are abandoned in the ultimate cognition of the All; ‘Why should philosophy be concerned if the fear of death knows nothing of such a dichotomy between body and soul, if it roars Me! Me! Me! … for all this dire necessity philosophy has only its vacuous smile’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3)</span>. Rosenzweig’s subsequent existentialism offers redemption from death by incorporating it into the system he builds throughout the book; the text opens with ‘from death’ and ends with the words ‘into life’. Rather than a conclusion, Rosenzweig later points to ‘into life’ as an invitation to verify the central motifs of the work, namely love, language and the name, ‘in the course of everyday life’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig cited in Glatzer <a href="5.html#Glatzer 1985" target="_blank" title="Glatzer NN (1985), ‘Forward’">1985</a>:xviii)</span>. The baggage and subjectivity of individual lived experience becomes foundational, prior to philosophy, and a source of insight instead of something to be overcome.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="183" class="position" href="m.html#183" title="Philosophy avoids death by avoiding presuppositions.">183</a></div>

<div>This is how Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> associates philosophy’s attitude towards death with its quest to avoid all presuppositions. Though death is a frequent theme in many philosophies, the fear of death is suppressed in a quest to follow Socrates’ lack of fear <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Plato <a href="5.html#Plato 1993" target="_blank" title="Plato (1993) The last days of Socrates">1993</a>:116a-118a)</span>, Schopenhauer’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Schopenhauer 1818" target="_blank" title="Schopenhauer A (1966) The world as will and representation: volume II">1818/1966</a>:469-470)</span> ‘indestructibility of our true nature’ or Nietzsche’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Nietzsche 1885" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1885/2006) Thus spoke Zarathustra: a book for all and none">1885/2006</a>)</span> ‘eternal return’. To acknowledge the terror one experiences before the imperceptible void of death is hardly a neutral vantage point from which to explore philosophical questions. Philosophy is in the habit of addressing this fear, solving it like a problem, a source of presuppositions and emotional biases that need to be overcome to see clearly and objectively. Philosophy is obsessed with presuppositions: Kant’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> entire philosophical project could be seen as an effort to address the issue of presuppositions in philosophy through an examination of the conditions of possibility for our knowledge; Hegel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span> dialectical process systematically uncovers and critiques the presuppositions inherent in each stage of consciousness, propelling a critical evolution of thought that subsumes and refines these presuppositions; and Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1968" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1968/2014) Difference and repetition">1968/2014</a>:174-183)</span> critique of ‘the subjective presupposition of philosophy as a whole’ is an elaborate elucidation of certain presuppositions like ‘the good will of the thinker’, common sense, models and representation. Yet for many — especially Rosenzweig, serving in an anti-aircraft unit during the First World War, writing these words on a small military postcard <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Pollock <a href="5.html#Pollock 2019" target="_blank" title="Pollock B (29 January 2019), ‘Franz Rosenzweig’">2019</a>:para.2)</span> — daily life is framed ‘over the grave which yawns at our feet with every step’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3)</span>. The philosopher revealing presuppositions assumes a more elevated position, so their philosophy can happen to the fear of death.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="184" class="position" href="m.html#184" title="Rosenzweig and Marcel emphasise lived experience.">184</a></div>

<div>Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> is not alone in the way he grounds his thought in lived experience, through the frame of mortality especially among others associated with his strand of existentialism. Death is an essential theme in the writings of Marcel <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72)</span> who noted that ‘Certain readers will be surprised at the role played by death, suicide, betrayal, in all of my writings’. For him, these themes were indispensable;</div>
	<blockquote><span class="small">I do not think we can ever ascribe enough importance to these, and any philosophy which tries to elude them or conjure them away, is guilty of the worst possible kind of betrayal.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Marcel <a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72)</span></blockquote>
<div>The ‘betrayal’ Marcel is referring to aligns his reasons for focusing on death with Rosenzweig’s. Both authors associate the acknowledgement of the experience of death with an acceptance of presuppositions. Throughout <em>Creative Fidelity</em>, Marcel <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:4)</span> resists any ‘claims to install himself at the centre of being’. This commitment to lived experience was demonstrated in the way Marcel presented his ideas and explored concepts in his plays and metaphysical journals <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Marcel <a href="5.html#Marcel 1949" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1949) Being and having">1949</a>; <a href="5.html#Marcel 2007" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (2007) A path to peace: fresh hope for the world: dramatic explorations">2007</a>)</span>. His thought commences from lived experience and, after exploring concepts within, points the reader back towards the same. Marcel shares this final invitation with Rosenzweig, though he differs in his determination to remain within lived experience itself, hence his sometimes preferred format of a daily journal, reflecting on his own death and the role it is playing in the development of his thought <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Marcel <a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:12)</span>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="185" class="position" href="m.html#185" title="Death shapes Buber’s philosophical anthropology.">185</a></div>

<div>Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>:16)</span> shares an anecdote in <em>Between Man and Man</em> which demonstrates how everyday life and the impact of death contributed to his thought:</div>
<blockquote class="small">What happened was no more than that one forenoon, after a morning of ‘religious’ enthusiasm, I had a visit from an unknown young man, without being there in spirit. I certainly did not fail to let the meeting be friendly, I did not treat him any more remissly than all his contemporaries who were in the habit of seeking me out about this time of day as an oracle that is ready to listen to reason. I conversed attentively and openly with him — only I omitted to guess the questions which he did not put. Later, not long after, I learned from one of his friends — he himself was no longer alive — the essential content of these questions; I learned that he had come to me not casually, but borne by destiny, not for a chat but for a decision. He had come to me, he had come in this hour. What do we expect when we are in despair and yet go to a man? Surely a presence by means of which we are told that nevertheless there is meaning.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Since then I have given up the ‘religious’ which is nothing but the exception, extraction, exaltation, ecstasy; or it has given me up.</blockquote>
<div>We can assume that this experience was foundational for Buber in the development of his thought. Some will regard it to be so, solely on the grounds of it being an instance of his conversion out of the religious enthusiasm that he previously embraced. But I share it here to highlight how Buber’s subsequent philosophical anthropology is grounded in everyday interpersonal acts of dialogue. The young man’s death, in the story, awoke Buber to the illegitimacy of a division separating, not only the temporal and spiritual life but a distinct vantage point in philosophy from which the whole can be circumscribed. Buber’s philosophical anthropology is similar to Rosenzweig’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> and Marcel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>)</span> thought because it embraces the subjective human perspective, which includes a fear of death. Indeed, it was through the regret Buber felt in the above story, when the reality of death entered his life, that he was brought down to the everyday.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="186" class="position" href="m.html#186" title="The Christchurch attack from a first-person perspective.">186</a></div>

<div>This reality can abruptly enter our lives at any time, as it did for me in a relatively small way compared to those closer to it, upon learning of the terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, 15 March 2019. The news reports showed footage from the attacker’s live stream, moments before he killed 51 people <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(ABC News <a href="5.html#ABC News 2019" target="_blank" title="ABC News (3 May 2019) ‘Christchurch mosque attack death toll rises to 51 after man dies in hospital’">2019</a>)</span>. From a first-person perspective we saw the attacker drive and get out of his car, then approach the mosque with his gun visible. News sites never released the full recorded live stream, so it always stopped moments before the attack. The perspective of the footage is significant, for it seems to demonstrate a truth that is easy to ignore about the horrors humans are capable of and one’s own potential as a human, that we share something with the terrorist as much as we would like to remove ourselves from him. Put another way, the first-person perspective invites you to imagine that you are the shooter. We see the world through his perspective which invites a greater level of participation in the image-event, closer to that of a videogame.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="187" class="position" href="m.html#187" title="Othering violence as a reaction.">187</a></div>

<div>The obvious reaction to this phenomenon is to distance ourselves from the man as much as possible: he is insane, a monster whom we share nothing with. On the day of the shootings, then New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ardern 2019" target="_blank" title="Ardern J (15 March 2019), ‘Christchurch shootings mark “unprecedented act of violence”, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says’">2019</a>:para.6-8)</span>, expressed such a distance which also reinforced national identity and values,</div>
<blockquote class="small">Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.</blockquote>
<div>But this recourse to national identity is not available to Australians who share their nationality with the terrorist. We must become separated from the evil being presented differently, by emphasising how incorrect the man’s beliefs about the world are and how far removed they are from our own. This is often extended to the point where one dehumanises the attacker, othering them as much as possible — ‘it was an inhuman act’, ‘he is a monster’.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="188" class="position" href="m.html#188" title="Seeking a redemption beyond loathing and disavowal.">188</a></div>	

<div>However, I will argue that this approach is ultimately unsatisfactory and that there is no lasting redemption in our impulse towards the othering of human turpitude. I do not mean redemption for the man who killed those people, but for ourselves and for humanity generally, as ones who share and participate in a world where such atrocities are not only possible but frequent. As we work to push the intentions, ideas and the humanness of evildoers as far from our own identity as possible, the more repulsed we become with humanity generally, our entire situation and thus with ourselves. While this kind of thinking is often motivated by deeply moral convictions, it ultimately leads to a philosophy like Ivan Karamazov’s. Not a disbelief in God or a higher purpose necessarily, but a rejection of the world and an attempt to disavowal our participation in it. For Ivan, the suffering of a single child cannot be worth any end, no matter how glorious, so he wants to give back his ‘ticket’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky <a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:245)</span>. As he puts it to his brother, ‘would you agree to be the architect of such conditions?’ — the Christchurch shooting and innumerable other atrocities notwithstanding. But as Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:451)</span> has explained, Ivan’s returning of the ticket</div>
<blockquote class="small">is to close oneself off in a vicious circle. Rejecting the world seals one’s sense of its loathsomeness and of one’s own, insofar as one is a part of it.</blockquote>
<div>The kind of redemption I have in mind here would entail escaping this ‘vicious cycle’ completely.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="189" class="position" href="m.html#189" title="Rationalising our position by rejecting the world.">189</a></div>

<div> In Ursula K. Le Guin’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Le Guin 1973" target="_blank" title="Le Guin UK (1973) The wind’s twelve quarters">1973</a>:251-259)</span> famous short story, ‘The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas’, a utopia is described that is conditional on the suffering of a single child. I heard someone refer to this story at an anthropology seminar about asylum seekers on Manus Island. It occurred to me at the time that what people were interpreting to be the final moral of the story, to be ‘one who walks away from Omelas’, entails many of the same moral motivations as Ivan’s rejection of the world. Many seemed deeply moved by the short description of the story notwithstanding, and we must acknowledge the moral courage behind gestures like those in Le Guin’s story or Dostoevsky’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> character Ivan. These rejections of the world are founded on the noblest of intentions. They are commendable, legitimate and justified in certain philosophical, political and ideological contexts — especially in the context I found myself in at that anthropology seminar at one of Deakin University’s ‘Corporate centres’. However, we have been developing a different context, which is less philosophical, more lived and immanently redemptive, like a videogame.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="190" class="position" href="m.html#190" title="The destructive tendencies of self-loathing.">190</a></div>

<div>The posture one assumes to walk away from the world, as a non-actor, so simply and effortlessly, can only come from a stance that assumes a non-participation in the image-event. And when this refusal to pick up the controller is applied so broadly, with totalising philosophical concepts, it slowly transforms from being self-righteousness to self-loathing and ultimately, as our three existentialists and Dostoevsky <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> have each argued in their own ways, suicidal. That is how Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3-4)</span> describes any philosophy that ‘takes upon itself to throw off the fear of all things earthly… [one that] can truly recommend only suicide, not the fated death for all’. Had Rosenzweig lived to witness the Second World War, it seems he would be been sympathetic to Marcel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1950" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1950) The mystery of being: reflection and mystery">1950</a>:23)</span> description of it:</div>
	<blockquote class="small">We live today in a world at war with itself, and this state of world-war is being pushed so far that it runs the risk of ending in something that could properly be described as world-suicide.</blockquote>
<div>If pre-world war philosophies like Hegel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span> are symptomatic of a condition that leads to mass death, the tragedy in Christchurch and others like it suggests we have not entirely grown out of those conditions. We are still clinging to the prospect of a transcendental enthusiasm like Buber’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>)</span>, to lift us out of the everyday anxieties of mortality towards something timeless and all-encompassing. Though we might express a flee from the world and death in a way that manifests very differently to Buber’s religious enthusiasm, philosophically in the domains mentioned at <a title="Philosophy avoids death by avoiding presuppositions." href="#183">183</a>, and practically in the disengaged postures we assume towards new images — occluding the aspects which make them new. Neither of these reactions to everyday-human-anxieties will come to terms with our participation in a world and images when that involvement is deeply troubling. Dostoevsky’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> characters who cannot meet this challenge ultimately destroy themselves and the lives of those they come into contact with. And this describes the condition we are behoved to seek a redemption from. It will be a redemption that is not philosophically detached or encompassing but a redemption that emerges through participation, as a new non-violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="191" class="position" href="m.html#191" title="Transcendence is a type of redemption.">191</a></div>

<div>First, I will acknowledge that it is possible to construe the distancing and rejection of the world described at <a title="Philosophy avoids death by avoiding presuppositions." target="_blank" href="#183">183</a>, <a title="Othering violence as a reaction." target="_blank" href="#187">187</a> and <a title="Rationalising our position by rejecting the world." target="_blank" href="#189">189</a> as a kind of redemption in itself — I will be broad here and only regard it as a general direction. This direction might entail, like Ivan Karamazov, returning one’s ticket (like relinquishing our biases towards anthropocentrism), or it could mean something profoundly spiritual and escapist. Regardless, rather than leaning into lived experience to acknowledge and continue a participation in the world and events, these stances seek to get beyond it somehow, be it morally, spiritually or philosophically. It is a cathartic diversion to insist the injustices of the world will never add up, that they do not need to or that God will somehow make them all add up in the end.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="192" class="position" href="m.html#192" title="All beliefs can lean in and out of lived experience.">192</a></div>

<div>While a more standard way of separating reactions to death and suffering is to consider those who believe in a higher purpose and those who do not, here we are getting at an entirely different distinction. There are atheists, theists and polytheists who lean into the experience of death and those who lean out of it. The atheist leaning out elevates their moral dispositions to condemn creation, while the theist might reject the world on the basis of original sin. This all needs to be briefly clarified here to separate our point from notions of religious belief or the spiritual. It is not a matter of belief but of coping — and coping on the level of second-order abstraction established in the previous chapter. I say they are ‘leanings’ because they do not represent the completion of a trajectory in or out of lived experience but are mere directions.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="193" class="position" href="m.html#193" title="Dostoevsky finds redemption in human connection.">193</a></div>

<div>Dostoevsky <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span>, the existentialist that he was, and unlike his character, Ivan, always leaned into the experience of suffering and death in his fiction. Much of this was, no doubt, inspired by several dramatic life experiences where leaning out, finding solace beyond this life, seemed unavailable. In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to death for belonging to a secret utopian society. However, his sentence was changed at the last minute. In a letter to his brother, he wrote:</div>

	<blockquote class="small">Then three of us were set against the posts so as to carry out the execution. We were summoned in threes; consequently I was in the second group, and there was not more than a minute left to live. I remembered you, my brother, and all yours; at the last minute you, you alone, were in my mind, and it was only then that I realized how much I love you, my dearest brother! I also succeeded in embracing Pleshcheyeve and Durov, who were beside me, and bade farewell to them. Finally the retreat was sounded, those who had been tied up to the posts were led back, and they read to us that His Imperial Majesty granted us our lives. Thereupon followed the actual sentence…</blockquote>

	<blockquote><span class="small">Brother, I am not depressed and haven’t lost spirit. Life everywhere is life, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed and not to falter — this is what life is, herein lies the task.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky cited in Pevear <a href="5.html#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii)</span></blockquote>

<div>During and after this close encounter with death, Dostoevsky found redemption in the present experience of being ‘a human being among other human beings’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky cited by Pevear <a href="5.html#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii)</span>, reflecting on the love he had for his brother and embracing his friends.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="194" class="position" href="m.html#194" title="‘We are all to blame’ is a type of redemption.">194</a></div>	

<div>It was perhaps the above experience that set Dostoevsky <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> on a trajectory to explore the themes of redemption in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. There is no better way to present Dostoevsky’s argument than the narrative provided in the book, but Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>)</span> effectively summarises its argument this way:</div>
	<blockquote class="small">What will transform us is an ability to love the world and ourselves, to see it as good in spite of the wrong. But this will only come to us if we accept being part of it, and that means accepting responsibility. Just as ‘no one is to blame’ is the slogan of the materialist revolutionaries, so ‘we are all to blame’ is of Dostoevsky’s healing figures. Loving the world and ourselves is in a sense a miracle, in the face of all the evil and degradation that it and we contain. But the miracle comes on us if we accept being part of it. Involved in this is our acceptance of love from others. We become capable of love through being loved…</blockquote>
<div>This accepting responsibility for the evils of the world entails a shouldering of universal guilt. The character Dimitri maintains that he did not murder his father but, by the end of the book, acknowledges that he wanted to. In this way, he still participated in or contributed to the forces of this world responsible for his father’s death. In the story, we see how this acceptance of guilt can open someone up to accept love from others, which in turn leads to a love and gratitude for the world <em>as we hope to make it</em> or what Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> would describe as a continual process of creation.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="195" class="position" href="m.html#195" title="We are guilty parties for our participation.">195</a></div>	
<div>I have never killed anyone, but I have been angry before; I have never shot anyone, but I have shot a gun before; I have never shot anyone, but I have seen a point of view similar to the one in Christchurch with a gun floating at the bottom of the screen while playing a videogame and I did shoot people. This is a radical leaning into the evil of the world, acknowledging oneself as a participant in the perpetuation of suffering and death.</div>

<div>The image of redemption presented via Dostoevsky <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> in these paragraphs is incomplete because it is inescapably tied to the image-object of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. But here we will perform a new image and a new kind of redemption. Fiction and other art forms can invite us into experiences that point back to the event of life itself. We can feel a silent explanation that is unique to our person, which can often be especially clear by virtue of the fact that it does not try to get behind anything like a metaphysical system and neither does it abandon life’s most precious components to a sea of entropy. Art does not try to get under experience, it lifts it up in a way that is redeeming. It points to creation, not the traditional seven-day biblical creation, but the Rosenzweigian notion of creation as a continual process. The universe is ever renewed, it keeps saying ‘yes’, which is the primordial <em>yes</em> of existence, and within that <em>yes</em> is a <em>no</em> and the <em>no</em> says, ‘not otherwise’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:27-28)</span>. Notwithstanding one’s own limitations and shortcomings and one’s broken participation in that <em>yes</em>, the ever-enduring base of things continues its resounding ‘not otherwise’ and hidden therein is the <em>yes</em> of creation <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span>. Art has a way of directing us back towards our participation in creation, the acceptance of which allows us to find beauty and redemption within our everyday lives.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="197" class="position" href="m.html#197" title="The Christchurch attack resembles videogames.">197</a></div>

<div>After viewing the footage of the Christchurch terrorist attack, mentioned at <a title="The Christchurch attack from a first-person perspective." target="_blank" href="#186">186</a> — with the first-person perspective and the gun visible at the bottom of the frame — it immediately reminded me of many first-person shooter videogames I had played. Of course, in most games within the genre, the player’s role is not to shoot innocent people, but the aggression and violence are still present enough to make the footage from Christchurch reminiscent of the gesture. This is not a new association and was most notably drawn from the Columbine shooting in 1999, even without the first-person footage to evoke the comparison <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(for example, Consalvo <a href="5.html#Consalvo 2003" target="_blank" title="Consalvo M (2003) ‘The monsters next door: media constructions of boys and masculinity’">2003</a>:38-39)</span>. And there are more recent examples, like Trump’s comments after two mass shootings that killed thirty-one people in 2019: 
	<blockquote><span class="small">We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Trump cited in Draper <a href="5.html#Draper 2019" target="_blank" title="Draper K (5 August 2019) ‘Video Games Aren’t Why Shootings Happen.

<div>At <a title="‘We are all to blame’ is a type of redemption." target="_blank" href="#194">194</a>, Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>)</span> described Dostoyevsky’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> way out of the loathing for the world and oneself that often develops as we try to cope with violence by extracting or putting an end to it, as Trump just suggested, or through a refusal to participate. This path could be summarised as <em>responsibility</em> and <em>care</em>. They are described here because of a connection I made between how the moments before the attack were presented in the media and my own participation in a similar kind of depiction of violence found in first-person shooters. This kind of shift into everyday life and one’s participation in an imperfect and evil world is not dependent on that connection, but it will serve as our trajectory here, into the problem of violence and videogames. We will take the kinds of redemption generally on offer in both philosophy and videogames as material, not to justify the presence of violent images in either practice, but to generate a new redemptive image <em>here</em>, in this image-event.</div>

<!-- need to reference Mega Man here -->
<div>Most videogames treat player mortality in a very similar way. In order to progress, a section must be cleared without dying. If the character you control does die, the section is repeated. There is a great deal of variation within this trope, for example, some fast-paced platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(McMillen and Refenes <a href="5.html#McMillen 2010" target="_blank" title="McMillen E and Refenes T (designers) (2010) Super meat boy [videogame]">2010</a>)</span> or <em>Celeste</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Thorson <a href="5.html#Thorson 2018" target="_blank" title="Thorson M (director) (2018) Celeste [videogame]">2018</a>)</span> have quick re-spawn times and plenty of checkpoints while roguelikes like <em>Spelunky 2</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Yu <a href="5.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> have what is called ‘permadeath’ where the player has to start the whole game again. Regardless of how this kind of death mechanic is integrated into a particular game, the general notion is the same — if you die, you get to try again. We could attribute this mechanic to the historical development and genesis of the medium, or describe replayability as an essential component that gives games in the broader sense value. We could bring the existence of death as the taken for granted lose-state in videogames into question, picking up Chris Crawford’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Crawford 1992" target="_blank" title="Crawford C (1992) 'GDC founder chris crawford's dragon speech'">1992</a>)</span> famous critique of the medium’s obsession with spatial representation, and the limitations that focus places on games themselves, violence and death in videogames then being the path of least resistance. Whatever the reason for this almost universal approach to player mortality, in light of what has been discussed in the previous paragraphs, we can attribute the appeal of this game mechanic to a kind of redemption. When one plays a videogame, another identity within another world is how the experience is often described and regarded. Death in a videogame is thought of as a representation, and though such is often done so in a narratively complex way, like in <em>Neir: Automata</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taro <a href="5.html#Taro 2017" target="_blank" title="Taro Y (director) (2017) Nier: Automata [videogame]">2017</a>)</span> or <em>The Last of Us</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Straley and Druckmann <a href="5.html#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>)</span>, there is little variation in terms of game mechanics as a way for the player to experience death in the game world. Thus, even in games that supposedly have something to say about death and player mortality like <em>Dark Souls</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Miyazaki <a href="5.html#Miyazaki 2011" target="_blank" title="Miyazaki H (director) (2011) Dark souls [videogame]">2011</a>)</span>, the redemption it presents is the same — you get to try again until you win and feel good about yourself. The posture assumed here is leaning away from the lived reality of suffering and death in the world. Death in a videogame can be disappointing, but the experience of it is far removed from the trauma of real death. Death is repeatedly depicted in videogames, you could play <em>Mega Man</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kitamura <a href="5.html#Kitamura 1987" target="_blank" title="Kitamura A (director) (1987) Mega man [videogame]">1987</a>)</span> for five minutes and die five times in a row, but it is rarely confronted for what it is.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="200" class="position" href="m.html#200" title="Realism is a type of philosophical redemption.">200</a></div>
<!-- not just Rosenzwieg but Laruelle too, maybe add an in-note -->
<div>This stance becomes more apparent as the industry continues to strive for higher levels of realism. The game is perceived as less abstract and resembles real life more closely but the death mechanic remains the same. The depiction of death, then, becomes more defiant and preposterous. Its function as a kind of redemption increases too in this regard because it has supposedly come closer to replicating the reality we need redemption from. This makes sense in the common description of videogames as a kind of escapism, but videogames can also serve here as a case study for Heidegger’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heidegger 1954" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1954/2013) The question concerning technology and other essays">1954/2013</a>)</span> description of technology when it is understood to be metaphysics completing itself. It has already been noted at <a title="Philosophers assume a posture towards the videogame image." target="_blank" href="2.html#147">147</a> how videogames, particularly in the pursuit of realism like in the case of virtual reality or ray tracing, are an expression of a philosophical stance towards the world. It is the kind of philosophical stance Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> was particularly critical of. With every new iteration of virtual reality or graphical realism, an underlying ontological stance is being demonstrated, a trajectory is being put on display, that says we are capturing reality by replicating it, and we are coming closer to the much anticipated perfect simulation. In such a simulation we will replicate every aspect of human experience, the motivation is there to do so, with one major exception, namely death.</div>

<div>The game does not give players an option here, we can either keep pushing the square button or stop playing the game. The only way to progress in the story is to participate in this image of violence, bring it about, and so it is like a rite of passage. But players are never fully in the act because of the presupposition that what is on the screen is only an image and the knowledge that we have only assumed a role. This is the misalignment Druckmann was talking about; we disassociate ourselves from the morality of the characters we control which is at odds with the act of playing the game. This tension also describes the problem of the violent image more generally, a phenomenon we, as participants, play an essential role in but which we will not hesitate to condemn on the grounds of its content. <em>Part II</em> shows how videogames can direct our attention beyond the confines of an image and towards the act of violence itself by making the performance that is imaging violence explicit.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="203" class="position" href="m.html#203" title="Computer generated violence is not equivalent to lived violence.">203</a></div>

<div>Computer-generated images of violence are not equivalent to real violence and while this seems obvious, it is an important aspect of media to acknowledge. This can often be forgotten with the ease with which we speak of certain images as ‘violent’. The image depicts violence, but it is not what violence is – at least not in the respect to which these descriptions are referring.</div>

As Alex Golub <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Golub 2006" target="_blank" title="Golub A (28 July 2006) ‘Economists and anthropologists on video game violence’">2006</a>:para.4)</span> noted, ‘there was no “real-life violence” in the study’, participants were only shown a ‘10-min videotape of real violence’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Carnagey et al. <a href="5.html#Carnage 2007" target="_blank" title="Carnage NL, Anderson CA and Bushman BJ (2007) ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’">2007</a>:492)</span> after playing a violent videogame, and their response levels were measured. Rather than revealing the desensitizing effects of videogame violence, this study reveals the researchers’ conflation of violent images and real-world violence. The researchers’ anxiety regarding the image is built on the presupposition that the image conveys phenomena in a way that is equivalent to a lived experience of violence. Their error is rooted in a confused problematic, also identified by Welsh <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Welsh 2016" target="_blank" title="Welsh TJ (2016) Mixed realism: videogames and the violence of fiction">2016</a>)</span> in the first chapter of his book, Mixed Realism, which places the real and virtual in conflict, but he still leaves open the possibility of the two being mistaken for each other.</div>

<div>Even more careful studies of videogame violence often participate in this conflation which is convenient to the criticism of the genre. This includes commentaries on videogame violence found in videogames themselves like in <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Davis and Coulon <a href="5.html#Davis 2012" target="_blank" title="Davis C and Coulon F (directors) (2012) Spec op: the line [videogame]">2012</a>)</span>. The game is a commentary on military shooters which draws attention to the player’s willingness to commit violent acts, but this is often accomplished by imbuing players’ actions with a false moral weight.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="206" class="position" href="m.html#206" title="The violent image is a distinct event.">206</a></div>

<div>The problem lies in equating the production of violent images with real violence. A loading screen from the game, quoted by Keogh <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8)</span> reads: ‘To kill for yourself is murder.

And Keogh is fully willing to go along with the metaphysical and ethically reductive implications of this description of killing; ‘Of course we aren’t “actually” killing when we kill in a videogame. But after playing The Line, I‘m no longer sure the answer is that simple’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Keogh <a href="5.html#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8)</span>. But it should become that simple the moment we compare the act of killing in a videogame to the act of killing in real life – something Sontag’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Sontag 2004" target="_blank" title="Sontag S (23 May 2004) ‘Regarding The Torture Of Others’">2004</a>:para.8)</span> well-meaning declaration fails to leave space for: ‘the horror of what is shown in the photographs cannot be separated from the horror that the photographs were taken’. This is not to dismiss the event of violent images in videogames or any other context, only to say that we are dealing with something entirely different from the lived experience of violence and that an effort must be made to maintain the distinction.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="207" class="position" href="m.html#207" title="Image-events can point to lived violence.">207</a></div>

<div>Of course, the image is real. Let us get to talking about what the image is and what is violent about it. Anyone who has experienced real violence or trauma in their life knows that dramatizations, rasterized animations or even actual recordings or photos do nothing to convey the lived experience of such events. To forget this is to reduce reality to the confines of a screen. Videogames and other visual media can point to real violence via what is irreducible in the art form and our participation in it as an event, but what we see in the finite image-object, if anything, is something to be overcome in that regard.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="209" class="position" href="m.html#209" title="The image can leave space for ineffable violence.">209</a></div>

<div>In the torture scene described at <a title="Part II entails a participation in violence." target="_blank" href="#202">202</a>, we never see the direct effects of our pushing the square button on Nora, though we hear her painful cries. The camera never leaves Ellie’s face. By not detailing the event with pixels on the screen, this lends an infinity to our actions in the game, an excess that enables the notion of an irreducible violence that can never be truly represented. This type of infinity was explored on the previous page at <a title="Mathematical infinity performs an enclosure of being." target="_blank" href="2.html#073">073</a>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="210" class="position" href="m.html#210" title="The embodied performance of trauma is irreducible.">210</a></div>

<div>Here is a posture that generates an offence in the violent image-object. This posture is encouraged by certain image-events and it can be enhanced through juxtapositions. We have already seen this at <a title="The (violent) image and performance are compared." target="_blank" href="1.html#020">020</a>, in anticipation of this page, with the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém’s execution contrasted with <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. A similar comparison can be generated here, with the footage of Muhammad. We can make <em>Part II</em> feel more reductive and inappropriate by considering it next to recordings of performed violence or its aftermath, in Muhammad’s case. This is because the recordings create a context in which we regard <em>Part II</em> as a representation. In such a mode, notwithstanding what the developers at Naughty Dog are careful to withhold, the torture scene is taken as an image-object, and we discover, in our experience of the image, an event which feigns a representation of violence and thereby a reduction of it. This is opposed to the reality of Muhammad’s embodied performance of trauma which, though it can be construed as a representation, is regarded more easily as a performance in relation to the violent event. But inasmuch as each image-event involves a participation in the reductive act of image making – they can all be regarded as forms of capture – each has the potential to transcend the same on some level as creative participation in a new and unresolved image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="211" class="position" href="m.html#211" title="Viewers bring the reality of violence to the image-event.">211</a></div>

<div>To regard an image-object is to frame an instance of representation — something has or is being represented — and in the case of videogames, the object of representation is often violence, death and human suffering. In this reduced state, the phenomena of videogames are mere image-objects, by-products of programming, animation, motion-captured performance, artistic rendering, etc. The image-object is visible when we see a performance that mimics the human suffering of some real event, but the image-event is only performed. It does not need to view the image in that way, it depends on how we participate. We experience an image of someone being killed in a film with special effects very differently to footage of someone who was actually killed in real life, not because of any qualitative difference in the image necessarily, but because of what we contribute to the experience of the image. This is made apparent in Spike Lee’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lee 2020" target="_blank" title="Lee S (director) (2020) Da 5 bloods [motion picture]">2020</a>)</span> recent film, <em>Da 5 Bloods</em>, in which fictional depictions of violence accomplished with special effects are interspersed with archive footage from the Vietnam War. The latter is more affecting because we know it is a recording of a historical event, even while the fabricated violent images appear more gruesome, detailed and, in a sense, more ‘real’. We bring the differentiating context from sources other than the image itself and this context contributes towards our experience and interpretation of the image. Real people have experienced suffering that corresponds to what is being conveyed in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Druckmann et al. <a href="5.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>, at least in terms of its severity, if not in detail – of that we can be sure. Thus, the game represents a scope of victims that is as broad as its failure to truly convey their suffering — we only have to approach it in the right way or put it in a particular context.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="212" class="position" href="m.html#212" title="The violent image constitutes a posture.">212</a></div>

<div>Traits of the image-object which signal its history — evidence of 3D rendering or something captured through a camera — can make a difference to how we interpret and participate in image-events. This is especially true of violent images in videogames, though they strive to resemble a camera’s recording, the image technology’s style is still distinct. However, this difference in experience is not the result of the technology used to generate the image itself. This association is a hallucination of the posture which generates image-objects. Rather, the different experiences of violent images are the result of bodily and intellectual postures already described on the previous page at <a title="Image-objects depend on postures." target="_blank" href="2.html#112">112</a>. We bring a great deal to all image-events to make them possible. How violent an image is, as a successful representation of human suffering, depends entirely on the mode in which it is generated; whether it is a representation or a performance, closed or open, captured or new, an image-object or an image-event. In Baudrillard’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Baudrillard 1995" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1995) The Gulf War did not take place">1995</a>:30-31)</span> <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, he describes ‘the impossibility of illustrating this indeterminacy of war’ when the images describing it are positioned to compete with advertisements for viewer’s attention; ‘the world and the violence of the world [has been turned] into a consumable substance’. Baudrillard’s critique here depends on there being something like an essential platonic ideal, within each violent image, that is occluded by advertisements. That if only these advertisements could get out of the way, changing the context in which people experience the images, they might better perceive through these image-objects, as discrete phenomena, the ‘indeterminacy of war’. But the possibility of war’s indeterminacy being represented here is not a matter of revealing the true nature and context of recorded images, rather it is a matter of assuming a particular posture. And different situations can make such a posture more accessible than others.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="213" class="position" href="m.html#213" title="The violent image reduces a human event.">213</a></div>

<div>And this realisation can help us to point more precisely at the actual violence occurring in the event of the image, which is the reduction of violence into an image itself. Viewers participate in violence via their participation in the generation of the image and in the reduction of that event. One redeeming factor for the torture scene described above, as an artistic exploration of violence, might be found in the decision to point the camera at Ellie’s face rather than at Nora’s mangled body, which we are left only to imagine. By doing so, the game at least directs our attention towards the role we have assumed and the real violence transpiring in the act of that assumption. The participation necessary for the violent image to exist is made a part of the image itself in the form of a button prompt.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="214" class="position" href="m.html#214" title="Videogame violence can point to the reduction.">214</a></div>	

<div>Consumers play a role in the production of any violent image, but <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> shows how videogames are in a unique position to draw attention to the actual violence taking place in that event. And we could even say videogames have the potential to show us how every image portraying the human bears some resemblance to this gesture of capture and, in this way, is violent. For, it is ‘a different nature that speaks to the camera than that which speaks to the eye’; Benjamin <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Benjamin 1931" target="_blank" title="Benjamin W (1931/2015) ‘Small history of photography’">1931/2015</a>:67)</span> saw how the camera revealed peculiarities about reality previously never thought of. But videogames are not a capturing apparatus. They do not reveal to us, with a new gaze, some unexplored style for apprehending an object in the world. Rather, videogames are revealing an unexplored style of apprehending and participating in images themselves. <em>Part II</em>, more than most videogames, makes the decision to participate in the generation of violent images immediately explicit. The player gets to consciously choose to bring about a flawed portrayal of violence, which will never encompass the actual phenomenon. A space is then made for this act to be responded to and problematized, which is exactly what this profoundly violent videogame is determined to do.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="215" class="position" href="m.html#215" title="Critiques of violent images often participate in them.">215</a></div>

<div>Critics who described <em>The Last of Us Part II’s</em> second trailer as ‘torture porn’ were drawing attention to how confronting the image was to behold <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Naughty Dog <a href="5.html#Naughty 2017" target="_blank" title="">2017</a>)</span>, how uncomfortable it made them feel:</div>
	<blockquote class="small">…The Last of Us Part 2‘s second trailer delves into torture porn realms of excessive gore, and removed from the context of a story exploring the reasoning behind that violence it felt severely jarring to watch. <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Tamburro <a href="5.html#Tamburro 2017" target="_blank" title="Tamburro P (30 October 2017) ‘The Last of Us Part 2 and its Excessively Violent Trailer Made a Bad Impression’">2017</a>:para.2)</span></blockquote>
<div>These kinds of observations are informed by levels of graphical realism, for how graphic an image of violence is described to be often hinges on realism or quantities of detail. Australia’s <em>Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games</em> says: ‘Impact [of violence] may be higher where a scene or game-play sequence contains greater detail… is realistic, rather than stylised’. And this is an accurate description of those violent images in media that seem to affect us the most, at least at the time of viewing. But these guidelines also state that ‘context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<em>Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games</em> <a href="5.html#Guidlines 2012" target="_blank" title="Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games 2012 (Cth)">2012</a> (Cth) ‘The Guidelines’)</span>. And while it is true these factors can change how we feel about what we are viewing, we need to ask what these contextualisations can do to justify the reduction that has taken place through our participation. Context notwithstanding, whether the violent image is a photo, recording, performance or animation, it always asserts to be and fails to become more than what it is. To complain that an image is too gruesome and realistic, in or out of the context of some broader artistic statement, is to fully participate in the violence of the reduction just described. It is to assume that greater levels of detail and more accurately simulated blood splatters actually approach the phenomenon of violence in some way. The violent image is being rejected on the grounds of its accuracy in the absence of an explanation; it has revealed too much without context and is fetishizing. But the actual violence of this phenomenon lies in the pursuit of realism itself and its totalizing implications, its irreverence towards otherness, and not in the spectacle of the image specifically. There is a degree to which no image of violence will ever be justified, never mind the profundity of the image’s role in some penetrating social commentary. Rather than concerning ourselves with how uncomfortable an image makes us feel, we should be concerned with the lost and unrepresentable otherness inherent in the process of image-making. Within the disregard for such, lies violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="216" class="position" href="m.html#216" title="The image-event presupposes an otherness.">216</a></div>

<div>Let us now regard the otherness we experience in the event of an image, to try and respond to it in a way that does not reduce it or encompass it philosophically. If our experience of the image depends on our posture, does then the presence of otherness in the image depend on the same and have we not then produced our own violent image, which reduces the Other? First, the Other is not present by virtue of anything achieved by the capturing apparatus, display or imaging technology. In accordance with what has already been said of violence at <a title="The violent image constitutes a posture." target="_blank" href="#212">212</a>, to perceive violence is to perceive suffering otherness, so the presence of the Other in an image event can be determined by what we give to the experience. The otherness of an image, according to the transcendental image-event, i.e. videogames, is not discovered, captured or represented; <em>it is generated as new in the last instance</em>. Do not misunderstand this as a kind of solipsism: the subject is not responsible for making the Other, but both the experience of otherness <em>and the subject</em> are generated within the real irreducible event. We regard this event in a unidirectional manner as always new, determined in the last instance. This is also how we regard the Other (which is anthropology’s obsession) according to the videogame. This is why, even within a finite image, the gaze of the suffering Other being conveyed can demand something from us. Of course the otherness we experience in the image is real, not in a way that affirms an image-object, but because the image-event is inexhaustible. When image-events evoke a confrontation with otherness in the abstract sense, or, in the case of war footage, when they direct us towards a distant Other we were previously unaware of, this is the result of our mutual becoming with/as the image-event. According to the typical image-consuming posture one assumes — that is, not according to the transcendental image — to ‘consume’ an image, one differentiates oneself from an image-object, this forms a sense of self which in turn posits the Other, within the image-object. So, the posture of an image-object forms the Other, which is necessary to perform its reduction. Levinas <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>:150)</span> asserts that the Other is a presupposition of the self, not just through negation but through a dialectical participation in the unity of the system. We enter into a becoming with an image, we give ourselves over to it, and there is an otherness present within that event. But this Other, like the image-object and the self, is only non-essential material. It is not the only way to participate in image-events, as the videogame keeps showing us. The transcendental image does not <em>need</em> an otherness and can be a more simple becoming that never returns to itself, being always oriented towards the new. However, this does not invalidate the experience of the Other in an image-event, it is legitimate and will not be circumscribed here. The pursuit of that circumscription, however, will be critiqued as real violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="217" class="position" href="m.html#217" title="The experience of otherness entails a demand.">217</a></div>

<div>I said this otherness in the event of the image can demand something from us, and it does this in a way that is not unlike any confrontation with otherness. The suffering Other, the other humans whose suffering we witness, demands an engagement from us that entails more than averting our gaze from theirs. One’s own suffering is always comprehended too keenly. It can be more than we can contain, overflowing and inexhaustible but nevertheless experienced in its entirety. The suffering Other is beyond us in a different way. There is a sense in which we cannot comprehend a part of what they feel. This is how the Other is able to demand something from us, by virtue of its inherent incomprehensibility. In beholding the incomprehensible suffering Other there is something to answer for, namely one’s own otherness: one’s lack of suffering or how one is suffering differently. This is the foundation of Levinas’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>)</span> ethics but also his metaphysics. Encountering otherness is the presupposition of our sense of self and experience generally. So, of course the image, as a human event, entails a confrontation with otherness and we need to elaborate more on what is peculiar to the otherness produced in the posture of image-objects.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="218" class="position" href="m.html#218" title="The violent image embodies the anthropological problem.">218</a></div>

<div>In describing the violent image, we have so far described what could be considered <em>the</em> anthropological problem – the problem of the Other and its conveyance. The pinnacle of otherness always transpires through violence and human suffering because no human phenomenon addresses the anthropological question – What is the human being? – more directly. For, that is when the existence of the human is put into question and is in a state of crisis. Thus, the violent image ought to be regarded as a profoundly anthropological phenomenon, even a kind of naive ethnographic presentation. The anthropologist would never claim an ethnography is an exhaustive description of a people’s otherness, in no way does it approach it. It is something different entirely. The best one can do is point towards another instance of humanity with a long list of reservations and provisos. Yet this is still enough to elicit and even demand an ethical response from us. And this can also be true of the violent image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="219" class="position" href="m.html#219" title="Part II explores violence through performance.">219</a></div>

<div><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a series of violent images and in this way, it presents a response to the anthropological question. But this is where its resemblance to ethnography ends. Likening this videogame to anthropological fieldwork stays closer to its status as a videogame event because players are required to participate in the generation of violent images in a more radical and explicit way than in a text or film. At <a title="We use cinema to start thinking about videogames." target="_blank" href="2.html#049">049</a> we cited ‘action’ as Galloway’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2)</span> primal word in videogames, because more than any other medium, a videogame is something that you do. You push the button which triggers a murder scene. It is easier for critics to feign innocence in relation to a text because words can be made an object distinct from the volition of the person reading them. It is likewise easier to criticise the violence of a videogame you have never played and only seen the trailer for. But once you have actually played the game, some innocence has been lost because your agency has enabled the reduction of violence into a finite image, an encompassment of the Other has been pretended. To understand videogame violence, one must play the game, but to play the game is to commit the reductive and totalising gesture described above, which is violent.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="220" class="position" href="m.html#220" title="The violent image is embodied.">220</a></div>

<div>Above we have located videogame violence in the event of generating a violent image and not in what we identify as the image itself or its content. One advantage of this position is how it allows us to maintain the true nature of violence as an embodied event. The body of the player plays a central role in the production of the image on the screen. The most obvious way this happens is, as has already been mentioned, by pushing a button or turning on the device. But this also extends beyond videogames as ‘embodied and materially instantiated’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Keogh <a href="5.html#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:43)</span> phenomena. Any image presupposes eyes for it to be viewed with and the position a person needs to be in to see and understand the image. Without a body gesturing, in a specific way, towards the pixels being displayed, there is no image, only a collection of pixels (for example, it is possible to perceive the pixels in a way that occludes the image by putting your face very close to the screen). As Merleau-Ponty <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:355)</span> has shown, perception is an event that involves one’s entire body, every part expresses the intention and participates in coming to terms with a phenomenon. This full-body apprehension is an essential part of what a violent image is and of the violent gesture we have been identifying. In order to understand the violence of a particular phenomenon, we need to return to the body, which, as Foucault <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Foucault 1975" target="_blank" title="Foucault M (1975/1995) Discipline and punish: the birth of the prison">1975/1995</a>:26)</span> has famously argued, is the plane on which ‘relations of power and domination’ are produced.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="221" class="position" href="m.html#221" title="Philosophical detachment occludes suffering and violence.">221</a></div>

<div>To forget this aspect of violence, to ‘veil the body’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Todes <a href="5.html#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:29)</span> in such a way, constitutes an irreverence towards the body of the suffering Other – which is the essence of violence. This is an idea that will always need to be returned to: bodily circumstances must be made explicit to contemplate and confront violence. But since Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span>, it has been possible to avoid a confrontation with the body by disregarding it for the conditions of having experience in general <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Todes <a href="5.html#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:38)</span>. To live in one’s body, as Cartesian dualism makes possible, enables a retreat from the ramifications of our bodily circumstances. The Cartesian stance holds that violence and survival might be necessary for the sake of my body, but that is not what I am fundamentally, and it does not describe the transcendental base of things. This has enabled Western philosophy to avoid a confrontation with the suffering body of the Other. This is how idealism leads to a detachment which enables an ignorance of violence, as was expressed in Rosenzweig’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)</span> criticism of Hegel <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span>; the body has no place in Hegel’s pursuit of the absolute cognition of the all, fear of death is denied along with an acknowledgement of the suffering Other. These bodies and the violence they experience have been occluded in Hegel’s grand narrative of dialectical notions. Spirit consumes everything, its progress is inevitable and the violence the body receives and the violence it commits is a non-issue.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="222" class="position" href="m.html#222" title="Reducing videogame violence veils the body.">222</a></div>

<div>Dismissing videogame violence as a mere image on one hand, or an accurate depiction of human suffering on the Other both veil the body in a similar way. The first removes the role of the body in the experience of the image entirely while the second reduces the body of the suffering Other to the confines of an image. But, as we have seen, videogame violence is not something transpiring on the screen and the suffering Other cannot be contained within an image. Violence, including the reductive violence present in the generation of an image, is something we do with our bodies. We are beyond considering the image as only an image-object; it must be understood as an event, an imaging. In videogames, the essence of the violence transpiring lies dialogically within the volition of the player and game developers, in their tendency to fold their gaze back towards an image-object, forming a circle, constricting the suffering Other.</div>

Violence is always more complicated than what an image can present it to be. We did not just stab this character’s neck, we gave ourselves, our bodies, over to the production of a finite image of a person dealing with extreme otherness, affirming their sense of self, struggling for survival and dying. And we have conquered this horizon of otherness, which arrived to us unfinished in the event of the image, by bringing an end to it, making it a representation, by effectively saying: ‘this is all there is’. We have delved into alterity with the tip of our blade and when we were done, all we found was an image of a corpse. We did this, not as an image of Ellie sticking her knife in someone, but with our own bodies we confronted an otherness. We have painted a picture of the suffering Other and said, ‘Here is the answer to the anthropological question. This is what the human is. We can show it with a gesture, and we can count how many pixels it took to answer the question’.</div>

Any player who does not experience more than a mere shift in perspective – that is, a complicating of their intentions in the game world and a sympathising with the other playable character, Abby – signals a failure on the developer’s part: ‘but I just didn’t find any of those characters or events remotely interesting’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Skill Up <a href="5.html#Skill up 2020" target="_blank" title="Skill Up (12 June 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part II - review’ [video]">2020</a>:22’39”)</span>. The developers have failed to produce an object of entertainment that elicits the emotional response critics and players have interpreted them to be trying to achieve.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="225" class="position" href="m.html#225" title="Videogames are not cultural artefacts.">225</a></div>

<div>But, as far as we are concerned here, this is not what a videogame is. Our response to <em>The Last of Us Part II’s</em> narrative will align with how we have come to regard videogames more generally. The violent images on the screen are not a series of cultural artefacts to be analysed. If we start from the phenomenon, that is playing the game, it does not direct us to regard it, even its story, as an object. Of course, we can make this true of any media. Any interpretation is also a participation of sorts, and a negative appraisal of a film or painting might well be attributed to a failure on the consumer’s or critic’s part. But in those cases, there is a collective acceptance, invited by the experience of the thing itself, that it is an object in question and that it already exists. And though everyone sees things differently, we can at least agree that we are all talking about the same thing. But none of this is true with videogames. We cannot rely on Bogost’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bogost 2015" target="_blank" title="Bogost I (2015) How to talk about videogames">2015</a>:ix)</span> likening videogames to toasters, which occludes too much of the phenomenon from the outset. The game does not exist until someone plays it, the player constitutes an essential part in the game’s becoming and no two instances of the game, no two playthroughs, no two stories, are the same. The context of every violent image is different for every person who plays <em>Part II</em>. The fact that the game has been scripted and planned out by Naughty Dog does nothing to change this because a videogame, before anything else, before it can be regarded as a thing, is something that you do. All other game elements are subordinate to the event of gameplay, which is determined in the last instance.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="226" class="position" href="m.html#226" title="Story elements emerge through play.">226</a></div>	

<div>Again, this includes the story. Cut scenes derive meaning from the context of gameplay and are even designed, written, performed and animated as a response to gameplay. In a recent interview, Evan Hill <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hill 2020" target="_blank" title="Hill E (2020) ‘How a Last of Us Part II level is made’ [video]">2020</a>:1’55”)</span> explained his process of designing a level in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> called ‘The Birthday Gift’. Hill talks about playing through a basic ‘block mesh’ with full character animations and sprites from the very beginning of the level’s two-year development. Visual elements, dialogue and even entire scenes which play a significant role in the game’s narrative emerged as products of this experimentation through play. Aspects of the characters we know as Ellie and Abby were iterated on through the process of playing as that character. Even before the game was playable, very early outlines of its story were built on the parameters and opportunities of the medium as something that is performed. From the beginning, these were characters to be played and it was a story to be actioned and not just observed. In this way, <em>Part II</em> is something you become along with and, in an important sense, you <em>are</em> Ellie and Abby producing these images of violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="227" class="position" href="m.html#227" title="Videogame characters are performances.">227</a></div>

<div>Phenomena we would typically describe as characters, under normal conventions for analysing film or literature, are strained under that classification in videogames – at least if we want to keep what the game <em>is</em> in focus. In many respects, Ellie and Abby are not just two characters you play as for ten hours each, they are performances, things you become or applications for your sense of self. So, for our purposes here, it is not enough to say that you empathise with a character by assuming them as a role and doing their actions for them in the game. In such a capacity, videogame characters function as a mobile representational container waiting for a player to inhabit. But here we will make things more complicated. Even if we consider the game’s narrative in isolation, the characters interpreted are in response to gameplay as the presupposition. Ellie and Abby, as characters presented during cutscenes and dialogue, are an answer to your act of playing. They are Naughty Dog’s reply to your decision to play – and to continue to play – in this image-event. Of course, that reply can contain within it all the elements we might identify in a film but leaning on this association would be a mistake. The meaning of any particular cutscene is framed by the actions you took to trigger it. The meaning and significance of the experience are fundamentally dependent on your participation in this dialogic act that is playing the game.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="228" class="position" href="m.html#228" title="Players lack control over the effects of their actions.">228</a></div>

<div>But none of this means players have ultimate control over the effects of their actions, because they, as selves, are not the only things happening in this event. While it is true that violent images are often not required and it is possible to sneak past enemies in the tall grass, there are other times when Naughty Dog forces the player’s hand, and progress is made conditional on the production of these images, regardless of how conflicted we feel about it. Ellie, as a character, feels like her life is out of control, like she is bound to this violent path, even when a very different and happy life is made available to her she cannot accept it. Availability of choices is not the issue here. Her sense of self has become tied up in a quest for vengeance, not only as a means of coping with grief but as a means of understanding the purpose of her existence. She has no other mode of being, this is what living and surviving in the world of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> entails, and this is how we play the game. Ellie the character is a description of that becoming. She is its manifestation. Like Ellie, players do not really have a peaceful option in this image-event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="229" class="position" href="m.html#229" title="Participating in image-events can show us our violence.">229</a></div>		

<div>And it seems that Naughty Dog wants us to come to terms with the violent image by participating in it, by revealing the violence within ourselves – the violence we are capable of actioning not only for the sake of revenge, but love, and for that which makes us fundamentally human. It is the characters in the game who cannot come to terms with their participation in the evil of the world, those who believe they can truly solve the problem of violence for good, who commit and are capable of the greatest and most inhuman atrocities for the sake of that vision. It can easily be argued that Ellie, the player, too, has taken up such a path, but this is something that can only be revealed fully from without, not while we are playing as Ellie. Hence the importance of Abby as a performance or alternative way of inhabiting the game’s world.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="230" class="position" href="m.html#230" title="The image-event shapes our sense of self.">230</a></div>

<div>However, these elements of the experience do nothing to stifle the unfolding image-event and the posture it encourages, the production of violent image-objects, through the creative act of gameplay. Agency has nothing to do with quantities of choice, which is like adding infinities together, but rather, is contextual, depending on the other postures made available in the image-event. And here it might be helpful to return to regarding videogames dialogically. Recall Buber’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1958</a>)</span> use of dialogue at <a title="The dialogic interplay constitutes and ‘in-betweenness’." target="_blank" href="2.html#090">090</a> as a way of understanding a particular relationality we can enter into with a person or object that cannot be reduced to either party. Our sense of self is conditional and constituted by these kinds of dialogic events, as was shown at <a title="The image-event presupposes an otherness." target="_blank" href="#216">216</a> with Levinas <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>)</span>. The self is not protected and isolated from the interactions we have with other people or things and neither is it isolated from the actions that are taken in the course of playing a videogame. A videogame frames the self within a particular dialogic situation and shapes it as much as anything else does. We obviously are not passive observers and a videogame is always infinitely more than an object we can analyse or critique. A videogame is what happens between devices and people, including game developers, and nothing that is essential to the experience can be located solely in any one party. As dialogue, a videogame is a dynamic event impossible to predict. No two people’s experiences are the same. Though players can only express themselves in the exact way developers have made possible, there is still an essentially unquantifiable and irreducible component – a part that is infinite, transpiring between the player, developers and game. Different playable characters can then be understood as different dialogic postures, different modes of participating in the image-event rather than different containers for our sense of self. Our participation in the videogame is more simple than that. We simply <em>are</em> those characters, according to the image-event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="231" class="position" href="m.html#231" title="Part II generates a capable empowered self.">231</a></div>

<div>In the dialogic event we are considering here, Naughty Dog’s role is to facilitate the player’s participation in images of violence, and this enables a certain becoming. Playing <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, one feels incredibly capable – like most action RPG videogames. Even if certain sequences are difficult or frightening, overcoming those only feeds that sense of empowerment. And there are really two instances of this, two becomings being generated because to play Abby feels fundamentally different to Ellie. Abby is more athletic and capable in some ways and this makes her feel dangerous. I felt dangerous and scared for myself, as Ellie, and anticipated having to try and kill her and wondered who I would be when the time came for these two ways of playing the game to coalesce. Each character signals a self-affirmation, a feeling of control, but the collision of these makes no sense according to the typical means by which this or any videogame is regarded, while we think of them as image-objects.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="232" class="position" href="m.html#232" title="Part II generates a conflicted self.">232</a></div>

<div>This contradiction in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a dialogic response to that feeling of empowerment. Playing the game, you become efficient at producing violent images that progress you through the story. So, Naughty Dog enables the framing of two conflicting senses of self and makes game progress conditional on the pursuit of violence towards the self as Other. When you are Abby trying to kill Ellie as an NPC (non-player character) that NPC is the impossible representation of your previously performed and posited self, which was generated within the same image-event. This is in a way that is more profound than looking in a mirror because the event is dialogic, and it no longer represents the performance you are in the habit of experiencing. So, there is a distance, but the confounding association persists that is irreconcilable. There is a temptation to retreat, to disengage from the game into the sense of self that is stable, informed by the objects and people around you that is the precondition for playing the game in the first place. This is how Naughty Dog can reveal the players’ actions and desires to the player, by letting them participate in the violent image they wanted but in a way that makes them feel out of control. Players do not get to choose who they are when the violent image-object is deployed, and it is often hard for us to comprehend what we are doing in this new event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="233" class="position" href="m.html#233" title="Videogames can perform an othering of the self.">233</a></div>

<div>This othering of the self is something that can only be understood from a posture external to the image-event because within the flow of playing the game it makes no sense at all: How can I kill Ellie when she represents my becoming in the game-world? Granted, the impermanence of death in games can be seen as the express denial of the death of the self, you can always respawn and try again, as we saw at <a title="Re-spawns are a type of redemption." target="_blank" href="#199">199</a>. But the presence of Abby, as a different way of being in the same game-world is something of a counterweight to the ambition of this typical death mechanic in games. When I am Abby, it is hard to believe there is anything I cannot kill. But can I kill myself as the Other? That feels like a real and strange possibility when playing Abby. Thus, playing Abby does more than reveal Abby to us as a person we can empathise with, it reveals Ellie, ourselves, as the Other. The image-event makes the production of otherness explicit and problematic, which is how this videogame performs a reorientation vis-à-vis the root of the production of image-objects.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="234" class="position" href="m.html#234" title="Abby entails the performance/becoming of otherness.">234</a></div>

<div>We realise that the becoming that was the unity of our sense of self in the context of the game was never ours to begin with and this is disorientating. This is how the othering of the self puts one’s own volition into question. It is like being shown that you were wrong, not just about some objective fact, but about yourself. You have overestimated your ability to comprehend the otherness you behold and the Other does not just overflow your grasp, but you yourself do as well. All are subject to the real. By playing as Abby, Naughty Dog and players convey the most radical othering of the self imaginable not because Abby epitomizes extreme difference in relation to Ellie or the player, but because she is the closest.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="235" class="position" href="m.html#235" title="Ellie entails the performance of violence and revenge.">235</a></div>

<div>At the beginning of the game, after Abby kills Joel (who we performed in the previous game) Ellie’s motivations for revenge, the player’s motivations, are henceforth framed by that event. Abby contextualises the event we enter into, as Ellie, and what we become. Every image of violence, every game mechanic and sequence are in pursuit of this revenge narrative or a violent image that will reconcile and fulfil Ellie as something that is performed. Of course, some players may not be invested in the story – they might only be playing the game for the gameplay – but remember that the narrative presented is a response to that gameplay. Playing the game already presupposes an intentional generation of violent image-objects. Ellie is a violent character because we are violent players and <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a violent game. During the first half of the game, as we play Ellie, Abby represents the impetus and motivation for our generation of the violent image. She is the closest horizon, the perimeter of what can be totalised as a self while playing the game. Playing Abby is the act of performing that horizon, it is the performance of the nearest Other in a way that threatens the self.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="236" class="position" href="m.html#236" title="The nearest other is more threatening to the self.">236</a></div>	

<div>For, the nearest Other is always more threatening to the totality of the self than the far-off. Radical difference is always easier to deal with if it can be kept where it is, if we can maintain its alterity because that alterity is what the current self depends on. Granted, we have been saying that to maintain one’s selfhood in the midst of external difference is the essence of identity. But to do the opposite, to allow the self to be affected by the Other, to sacrifice the current security and unity afforded by the self as a totality, is what anthropology could be if it stopped doing philosophy, if it recognised itself as an image generating performance and became only interested in generating new images of the human. This is something made available in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, through the performance of Abby and through our disorientating participation in the production of a violent image depicting violence against our sense of self. This works by pushing our performance of the image, via the internal contradictions mentioned above, into a second-order abstraction where the two selves of Ellie and Abby are mobilised as materiel.</div>

<div id="v6" style="display: none;" class="details">
	<div>The performance, our participation in an anthropological image-event, is explicitly described by practitioners (anthropologists) as the generation of an image-object. This anthropological image-object is generated via the assumption of a hallucinatory posture which straddles <em>the anthropological question</em>: What is the human? But unlike the image-object — e.g. the ethnography, journal article, concept, record, etc. — this question itself is often not stated explicitly because it is hidden in unreflective performance. The image-event or performance of anthropology will be elaborated here in a way that (1) reveals the hidden anthropological question which (2) shows the discipline’s intention to generate an image-object, thereby (3) making anthropology subject to the same continuing observations emerging in response to violent images and videogames.</div>
	<br>
	<div>We have just described the structure of the image of anthropology needed for our current purposes and context, i.e. the violent videogame image. The question in question is rarely posed in any way whatever today. It has become more common to describe anthropology’s scope and mission with an emphasis on humanity’s diversity; for Ingold <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ingold 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (2014) ‘That’s enough about ethnography!’">2014</a>:388)</span>, ‘to do anthropology’ is to study ‘the conditions and possibilities of being human’ and Strathern <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Strathern 2005" target="_blank" title="Strathern M (2005) ‘Prologue’">2005</a>:xii)</span> has located the ‘genius of anthropology’ in its ‘descriptive engagement with the act of description, with how people generate accounts of themselves’. These and similar definitions allow different ways of framing anthropology to affirm its function as a mode of representation without clarifying or elaborating on what the discipline ought to represent. This ambiguity around the human, what it is, and anthropology’s expansion into post-humanism, is symptomatic of its willingness, even its political need, to give up first ethnocentrism and now anthropocentrism. However, this is always accompanied by an unwillingness to give up representation itself, again for political reasons — for example, new representations are needed to challenge harmful stereotypes — and for practical reasons. Anthropology has developed a way of addressing the anthropological question, which produces the image-object it needs in the context of academia, journals, publishing, its identity as a discipline among other disciplines, capitalism, etc., without actually stating it (What is the human?) and this is because there are subtle but complex philosophical, political and ethical implications for anyone willing to take it up, for anyone willing to represent (reduce, frame, make an object out of, make one’s output an image of) the human.</div>
	<br>
	<div>All anthropological research holds the anthropological question as its presupposition; the question is a feature of anthropology’s real performance. This includes when ‘What is the human?’ has not been expressly stated and the research has other stated objectives, like the description of political violence, racism, drought and famine <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Wutich and Brewis <a href="5.html#Wutich 2014" target="_blank" title="Wutich A and Brewis A (2014) ‘Food, water, and scarcity: toward a broader anthropology of resource insecurity’">2014</a>)</span>, etc. Not only are these still relevant to this question of inexhaustible scope – the human being as a condition of asking questions has got to do with everything – but they contribute to its essential totalising gesture. The act of research assumes some ground can be gained regarding what the human is.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Nevertheless, the process of doing anthropology, then, is still an inexhaustible one and this scope is an inherent feature of all anthropological research. In three paragraphs, I will reference Lévi-Strauss’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>)</span> construal of the anthropological question, but this or any act of interpreting the question, creating a mission for anthropology, isolating what it means to do anthropology, does nothing to limit the object of inquiry. Conversely, it embraces its vastness, follows through, enacting an ambition equal to Kant’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>)</span>. Kantian-inspired reflexivity towards the conditions of engagement, like structuralism, does give anthropology an object in the conditions themselves, a ‘wide and stormy ocean, the true home of illusion’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kant <a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:A236)</span>, so vast that it consumes the researcher. And this reflects the totalising nature of the question. The act of limiting presupposes an object of inexhaustible scope, takes the question seriously, and thus participates in the question’s totalising gesture. The human will always be the most expansive object to study because it is the means by which there are any objects at all. This is what Kant <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538)</span> meant when he made all philosophical questions subordinate to the anthropological one.</div>
	<br>
	<div>From here the obvious critique of anthropology is that it is too broad, its subject too big. I have heard anthropologists boast about their discipline at conferences, saying that while other human sciences might study humanity’s individual parts, (physiology studies the body, psychology studies the brain, etc.) only anthropology studies the whole human – ‘To argue for holism is to state the obvious in anthropology’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Parkin <a href="5.html#Parkin 2011" target="_blank" title="Parkin D (2011) ‘Introduction: emergence and convergence’">2011</a>:1)</span>. These assertions are declaring ‘What is the human?’, with all its scope and ambition, as a premise of the enterprise. The idea is not ambitious in a way that designates everything imaginable to anthropology. No one has been doing anthropology unbeknownst to them. It is that anything <em>can</em> be viewed and incorporated into an anthropological image-object when viewed in the right way; anything can be made relevant. And we can take things further still, beyond mere relevance. Any phenomenon, in itself, can serve as the <em>entire</em> means of access to an understanding of the human. It only takes a researcher to make the question of the human explicit in that particular instance. And how can this not be the case? We have got to do with everything we experience, we are humans, and anything can tell us something about what the human is, ad infinitum, if we can find the right way to think with it.</div>
	<br>
	<div>When anthropology presents itself as a science, this status can be a means of diverting any direct and explicit consideration of the anthropological question. It can allow the anthropologist to maintain a hubristic philosophical posture, gaining access to philosophy’s ambition and scope, but also science’s empirical grounding. It is a posture of authority in relation to the human as a subject of interest, without the features of the image-event itself, the real practice of being a human, doing anthropology in a particular way, ever surfacing to undermine the circumscribing authority of the image-object. The anthropologist uses this object to contribute towards a description of what the human is, in a way that is anthropological, which entails regarding all humans in a particular way – in a way that makes everything relevant to the question. Despite the holistic perspective that this approach affords, the original question remains unexamined behind a dangerous mixture of science and philosophy, freely taking the authority it needs from each, to validate its image-object in a way that is always sufficient for the context.</div>
	<br>
	<div>For example, Lévi-Strauss’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>)</span> structural anthropology exemplifies the creative thinking that must take place when the anthropological question is confronted for its own sake. How can there be a specific object when ‘our researches very much transforms their object’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>:19)</span>? For, Lévi-Strauss understood that the anthropological question does not ask for a description of any specific object, but a description of what is conditional on there being any object whatever. The best we can do is show how the object in question is expressing itself: What is the structure of the human being as a performance? What are the elements of this structure? This is why Lévi-Strauss <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>:16)</span> associated social anthropology with semiology – ‘its object of study the life of signs at the heart of social life’ – and did not evoke social anthropology’s foundation in the anthropological question explicitly. To ask, ‘What is the human?’ and expect a straightforward description is too much. There is no ‘atom of kinship’ to be described,</div>
		<blockquote class="small">…we do not need to explain how the maternal uncle emerged in the kinship structure: He does not emerge — he is present initially. Indeed, the presence of the maternal uncle is a necessary precondition for the structure to exist. <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Lévi-Strauss <a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>:46)</span></blockquote>
	<div>In this way, Levi-Strauss’ structural anthropology hinges on a Kantian critique, which puts constraints on the question itself. We must only ask for an incomplete picture, a description of the relationship between humanity’s elements, rather than purporting to uncover the nature of the elements themselves. Thus, Lévi-Strauss demonstrates an acute awareness of the problematic nature of the anthropological question. And none of this awareness is distracting from the anthropological project but is the source of Lévi-Strauss’ most valuable contributions to the discipline and beyond, namely structuralism. Structuralism’s successes in anthropology, according to the image of anthropology being developed here, can thus be attributed to its use of Kantian philosophical critique, which enables a safe space for the deployment of scientific image-objects; only relations are described, not things themselves.</div>

	<div>More recently, when anthropology deploys certain philosophical concepts to supplement ethnographic practice, these are necessarily philosophically underdeveloped so as not to lose a foothold in the grounding of their ethnographic data — maintaining the discipline’s status as a science. Philosophical concepts, which are light and mobile, like those found in Deleuze and Guattari’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1980" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1980/2013) A thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia">1980/2013</a>)</span> <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, or Latour’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Latour 2005" target="_blank" title="Latour B (2005) Reassembling the social: an introduction to actor-network-theory">2005</a>)</span> Actor Network Theory are popular and useful candidates, the latter being specifically designed for said purpose. Effective anthropological image-objects often present sprinklings of philosophy in ways that make them seem to emerge out of the data while hitting the necessary political critiques of colonialism. Reflexivity and positioning have become staples because they generate an ethically appealing image-object, more modest than a totalising philosophy, thus certainly not colonialist.</div> 
	<br>
	<div>But all these are a means of not stating the question one is actually addressing, or concealing the decision one has made in practising anthropology, playing the game, producing an image-object of the human. What is the human? Show me. And the anthropologist answers, they push the start button and say, ‘Look here’. In this way the anthropological question has stayed the same since Kant <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538)</span> first asked it in his lectures, and is yet to achieve non-violence.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Anthropology’s image-object is violent because the image-event of its production entails grasping what we have determined as our point of access in a particular way. Anthropology asks the player to frame the human in relation to the question. This is a violent thing to do in how it is a reduction. Anthropology is not unaware of its violent aspects but they are usually contextualised and put at a distance in the discipline’s history; it used to be a handmaiden of colonialist expansion, but now it is reflexive, it makes space for people to tell their own stories through auto-ethnography, an intellectual platform. But this platform is also a container of a particular shape, the shape of the Other – that is, an instance of the human or expression of humanity that is different (at least for the reader). Regardless of the anthropologist’s proximity to the phenomena being represented as an image-object, the presentation is not for the human phenomena’s own sake but for the sake of the anthropological question. Because the question is what frames the engagement, the questioning anthropologist has made an inevitable reduction. This experience is an object for my intellectual pursuits, and I want to harness its difference to serve my own question, to broaden my picture of what the human is or can be. My goal is to pull you into this image-event, which will make you see my image-object of the human. Herein lies the hostility of the question: ‘What is the human?’, as a pervading potential contextualisation for all our engagements with the world. Perhaps this is why Ingold <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ingold 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (2014) ‘That’s enough about ethnography!’">2014</a>:386)</span> paints ethnography as a type of engagement that occurs after the fact and in retrospect. Buber <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:73-74)</span> — though his thought is a philosophical anthropology, he still illustrates a response to the same problem — talks about the importance of not having the question in mind during the event in question, not assuming an objective stance. But in these examples, the gesture remains essentially unchanged whether it occurs during fieldwork or afterwards. And, as we saw with Lévi-Strauss <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>)</span>, problematising the question itself does not help here either because limiting or reframing it acknowledges the totalising nature of its object. To pick up the question, to do anthropology, frames the Other within a container of representation and, in this way, is a violent event according to its production of an image-object.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Now, of course some of the most recent developments in the discipline have been an effort to overcome this violence through an anti-colonialism. We see this in Viveiros de Castro’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal Metaphysics">2014</a>:40)</span> definition when he defines anthropology or describes its new task as the decolonisation of thought. The problematic he uses to introduce this idea in <em>Cannibal Metaphysics</em> is exactly Kantian. He is asking where anthropology’s ideas come from, the colonialist stance being to attribute them to the anthropologists themselves or the discourse emerging within the discipline. The decolonising stance is then to attribute anthropological insight back to the people anthropologists study, to give it back to them, and elevate them as potential anthropologists. Viveiros de Castro wants to address a similar problem to Kant <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> — How are a priori synthetic judgements possible? — or in other words, where do the concepts we employ to understand what we encounter in the world come from? We know Viveiros de Castro’s intentions match this Kantian ambition, otherwise he would not talk about decolonising thought, he would be more specific about his reference to the discipline of anthropology. ‘Thought’ has historically been a process that, if it did not follow colonialist gestures as explicitly as anthropology has, it has at least been the benefactor of imperialism and the political apparatuses connected to it. The institutions of thought, those in the business of generating thought, the university, academia, presuppose a logic of extraction and accumulation which decolonisation entails the dismantling of. The irony of what Viveiros de Castro is suggesting is that the human science, what was once the spearhead of the colonising logic of thought, enacting the dehumanisation inherent in the extraction and accumulation of the human as object of thought, anthropology, will now be the source of a kind of redemption, where things come full circle. And the broadness of this vision entails a radical stance on the Kantian problematic. Where Kant laboured for a compromise between Newton and Leibnitz – a mutual involvement of the a priori and a posteriori in the generation of experience, transcendental idealism, where a priori rules that are the preconditions of experience (idealism) allow us to confront discoverable otherness (science, objectivity, etc.), thereby unifying philosophy and science – anthropology cannot abide such an in-between stance. The reason for this is that the otherness anthropology has come to encounter, leads to a questioning of the validity of science. And the motivation presupposed in the entering into the problematic of the source of knowledge, unlike Kant, is normative and aware of a narrative nearing the end of its Karmic cycle. So here anthropology will simply pick a side in a way that will defuse the problematic entirely, anthropology will opt for perspectivism, a radical tolerance that gives everything over to the Other as the rightful owner of the originalities anthropology has historically taken credit for discovering.</div>

<span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Evans <a href="5.html#Evans 2023" target="_blank" title="Evans B (2023) Videogames for a new anthropological image">2023</a>)</span>. We produced this image here with the intention of generating an image of anthropology that can be made subject to the same critique as the violent videogame image, but also ultimately the same openness and redemption. We are generating an image-object here, making a reduction which is a folding of these two disparate phenomena into each other, in such a way that values what is enabled by that performance more than how successful it is at representing its materials. We are glossing over differences that could be called fundamental, to locate the violence in both videogames and anthropology, not in their content, but in their practice. They are not violent because violence is contained within their image-objects, they are violent because their image-events perform a style that hallucinates closed, totalising image-objects. Here we are concerned with the violence of image production as a practice. Let us now redeem them together, by generating an open image that can fit them both, and which following the path of the videogame, shifts their practice away from representation, so that we can describe them together as potential, irreducible, uni-directional, open non-violent events.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="238" class="position" href="m.html#238" title="Outer Wilds explores death and redemption.">238</a></div>

<div><em>Outer Wilds</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Beachum <a href="5.html#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>)</span>, is able to explore death and offer its own kind of redemption that is unique to gaming. In it, we explore a solar system of planets in a spaceship, discovering the remains and translating the texts of an ancient alien race. Through this process, we piece together how this civilisation came to the solar system and its extinction. After twenty-two minutes of exploring, the sun explodes in a supernova killing the player and everything else with it. After this, we are sent back in time to the beginning of the game to start again. There is no form of combat or enemies to fight, the only gameplay loop is to solve the puzzle of the narrative. That is, to find out why the sun explodes, why we keep getting sent back in time, and if there is a way to stop it and save the world or at least ourselves.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="239" class="position" href="m.html#239" title="Death in Outer Wilds is frequent and accidental.">239</a></div>

<div>Despite the lack of violence, death is continually present and depicted in a number of ways. Player death is frequent, even besides the supernova that sends us back to the start of the game every twenty-two minutes. Because the game has no enemies, players always die due to some accident, peculiarity in the environment or naturally occurring phenomena. This often makes death feel somewhat meaningless, the result of chance in an indifferent universe. There is never any intentionality behind our death, no enemy to kill us, only our own mistakes and pure entropy. For example, players might forget to put their spacesuit on before exiting the spaceship or an island launched out of the atmosphere by a giant twister could collide with the player. Death in <em>Outer Wilds</em> is not the result of any conflict besides a very grand existential kind of conflict between us and the universe. While the play, die, repeat death mechanic mentioned at <a title="Re-spawns are a type of redemption." target="_blank" href="#199">199</a> is still very present here, that mechanic is being employed to express something about our fundamental situation as human beings. There is no avenging death on a second playthrough, it just happened because death is part of living in the world.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="240" class="position" href="m.html#240" title="Texts reveal an ancient civilization’s quest for redemption.">240</a></div>	

<div>This is the context in which we read texts from an ancient civilisation, who are also grappling with their place in an indifferent universe, seeking redemption therein. We learn of the tragic circumstances that left them stranded in the solar system, their failed attempts to discover the deepest secrets of the universe and how that curiosity and quest for redemption ultimately led to their extinction. We read dialogues of them coming to terms with the finite nature of the universe:</div>
<blockquote><span class="small">This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will die. That’s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won’t happen in our lifetimes. But it’ll happen in someone else’s, someday!</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Beachum <a href="5.html#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>)</span></blockquote>
<div>It is a game about how life, even on a cosmic scale, is fundamentally finite and chaotic.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="241" class="position" href="m.html#241" title="Interactivity performs a type of redemption.">241</a></div>

<div>But this is only half of the experience the game offers, as this focus on death enables it to provide a kind of redemption that is both poignant and unique to videogames. Further, it is not the kind of redemption we referred to at <a title="Transcendence is a type of redemption." target="_blank" href="#191">191</a>, which we find in many other videogames that lean out of lived human experience — it is a redemption notwithstanding the videogame image’s compulsion to invite players into the production of a violent image-object. <em>Outer Wilds</em> offers a redemption that is not unlike what we see in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky <a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>)</span> and it provides such in a way that is only possible through an image-event not looking to close the image, but as a videogame, it is always unfinished.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="242" class="position" href="m.html#242" title="Aesthetic discovery is a type of redemption.">242</a></div>

<div><em>Outer Wilds</em> can be redemptive in a mode or posture where the image-object acts as a signal, like Rosenzweig’s final words mentioned at <a title="Rosenzweig critiques philosophy’s neglect of death." target="_blank" href="#182">182</a>, pointing to the real without assuming to be a representation of it. We can elicit these qualities from the videogame by performing it in a particular way, noting how the game’s developers are not aiming for a realistic image, but caricatures of styles and movements, the experience of the movement of the planets circling the sun, the blackness of space, contrast of stars, the unfolding of a mystery in what feels like, in its performance, a limitless space. <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo25()" id="btn25">OPEN</button>

This image emerges as a field of action, a plane, not a line. It feels like a space we enter, not something we perceive. The videogame image does not come to us to validate or justify or redeem us from our current position; we perform it and the performance requires and presupposes a particular posture that changes the role all positions play because we are thinking in terms of the next action, always open towards a new image-event. We do not see the planets in motion, each eclipsing the sun in its turn, from or through the display, we see them from our spaceship, and the effects of the phenomenon come from this whole immanent situation. It comes from a situation which is, so far, not yet an image, it is only an event. </div>

<div>An epiphany that is available in <em>Outer Wilds</em> — for it can only be made available — is not unlike Alyosha’s in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. Rather than trying to make everything in the universe add up in a particular way, Alyosha accepts his participation in what is wrong with the world, he takes on something of that responsibility and this opens his eyes to the constant miracle before him: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo7()" id="btn7">OPEN</button>

<div id="v7" style="display: none;" class="details">
<div>Filled with rapture, his soul yearned for freedom, space, vastness. Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. White towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars… Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.</div>
<br>
<div>He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. ‘Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears…’, rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and ‘he was not ashamed of his ecstasy’. It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, ‘touching other worlds’. He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh not for himself! But for all and for everything, ‘as others are asking for me’, rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind — now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. ‘Someone visited my soul in that hour’, he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words…</div>
<br>
<div>Three days later he left the monastery, which was also in accordance with the words of the late elder, who had bidden him to ‘sojourn in the world’.</div></div>

<span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky <a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:362-363)</span>. Of course, while Alyosha did not question his desire to kiss and love creation with all his heart, from that moment in the story the character does actively question and participate in the role he interprets to be his calling, that is to ‘sojourn in the world’ — not to transcend it or represent it or intellectually solve it somehow, but to participate in it, accepting his participation in evil and actively trying to be that which is redeeming in the world, not seeking personal redemption but that of the world’s. 

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="244" class="position" href="m.html#244" title="Videogames are dialogic events.">244</a></div>

<div>This is the kind of thing we do as the player in <em>Outer Wilds</em>. In this way, it is not a game that holds your hand, it will never tell you what to do next. We, as the recipients of death and entropy in this world of chaos, choose to be a part of it, through the recognition of its value and beauty notwithstanding death. Doing so entails, like Alyosha, our own ‘sojourn in the world’ as we attempt to be part of the solution, leaning into our own participation in the image-event, which entails a searching for redemption over its ultimate acquisition. It is a radically immanent redemption emerging <em>within</em> (not <em>through</em>) the process of seeking, performing and solving the world by being in it — not rejecting destinations, image-objects or solutions, but making them subordinate to, as support, serving, the lived event. Redemption comes via a particular type of learning, playing, experiencing, being present, which I have called a posture. This posture is something videogames automatically encourage — notwithstanding the industry’s quest for the cinematic image (<a title="Videogames strive for the cinematic image." target="_blank" href="2.html#054">054</a>) or realism (<a title="Videogames can perform photorealism as a goal." target="_blank" href="2.html#134">134</a>) — in the same way life automatically encourages it, and it is only through great philosophical labour through history that our habits of thought can be so easily inclined to undo it. Every redemptive experience is a creative and real event, and <em>Outer Wilds’</em> gameplay, its mechanics deployed by the developers, and visuals, create a space for the player to participate in a redemption. The game has a story, but this story does not get in the way or reduce the image-event itself. And <em>Outer Wilds</em> is not alone in the redemptive playspace it generates; nothing about the game design is unprecedented, we have only been slow to recognise what videogames can have us do, in a way that is anterior to what they show us as image-objects.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="245" class="position" href="m.html#245" title="Videogames are explicitly dialogic (redemptive).">245</a></div>

<div>On top of Deleuze’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span> observation about things concealing their essence in their genesis (<a title="Is the videogame concealed as cinema?" target="_blank" href="2.html#053">053</a>), this slowness is due to an ignorance of the videogame image-event. Many people like to defend the artistic merit of the medium (<a title="We use cinema to start thinking about videogames." target="_blank" href="2.html#049">049</a>), advocating for an acknowledgement of creative expression on the level of films or literature. Of course, the creative merit of a game’s constituents is never disputed, e.g. the story, music or visual assets. The concern is whether a videogame as a whole should be culturally recognised and valued in the same way a classic film is. But as we have seen, and compared to these other mediums in terms of the posture presupposed to participate in the image-event, to regard a videogame as a cultural artefact is to occlude its essence. And if there is an <em>essence</em> of the videogame, because a videogame is an unresolved event and everyone who plays a game, every separate instance of its happening, is fundamentally different, it is an essence which can only be described via an entirely different mode. For example, on the <a title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL" target="_blank" href="2.html">previous page</a>, we found a way to regard videogames, not as single works, but as dialogic events, between players, designers, apparatuses, etc. A videogame is designed with players in mind, attempting to create a particular experience within a set of parameters. Players then respond to and act within the system that is being presented to them. There is a degree to which the game designers have no control over what the player will choose to do and thus how the experience will be interpreted. Sometimes games are frustrating when designers and players misunderstand each other. In all these cases, videogames are the context and not the content. Their role us context generating image-events is immediately explicit and presupposed in the act of gameplay. If we are to locate the videogame, we can only do so on a level of second-order abstraction, so that videogames are a creative real movement, where the means by which there are image-objects becomes the manipulated material.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="246" class="position" href="m.html#246" title="The violent videogame image is unresolved.">246</a></div>	

<div>This is the transcendental image sought on <a title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL" target="_blank" href="2.html">page 2</a>, which entails regarding videogames as real lived experiences, contrary to how they are typically regarded as a type of escapism. In the escapist’s mode, a videogame saturates players in a world of pure intentionality. That is, everything happening in the image-event is deliberate and placed there for the player, who is a recipient of an authored experience. Here, the player is the centre of the world and a rock on the ground or a tree in the distance was put there <em>for them</em>, either by a designer or an algorithm. This mode is self-validating and playing a videogame, according to this posture, makes us passive recipients, placing us at the centre of a virtual world separate from the ‘real world’. This is how we are in the habit of thinking about videogames: as image-objects orbiting and serving us, we tacitly absorb their virtual phenomena. But this posture, along with escapist values, immediately crumbles when players push the start button. As soon as we act into the event and are emancipated to contribute to the image-event, the videogame becomes part of <em>this</em> world, the world of our bodies, and we are not at the centre but are manifestations, symptoms of an irreducible real event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="247" class="position" href="m.html#247" title="The violent videogame image is unresolved.">247</a></div>

<div>Real violence, beyond the production of a violent image is an unresolved, real and irreducible event. So, videogames have an advantage in the process of acknowledging that irreducibility in the performance of generating violent images. For, as a transcendental image, the videogame has, as its material, the process of violent image generation. This entails drawing attention to the unresolved nature of the videogame event itself, which can then be extended to all image-events, including anthropology, through the application of a new posture.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="248" class="position" href="m.html#248" title="Videogames and anthropology share a violent gesture.">248</a></div>

<div>The violence of the reductive force of representation is available through videogames in the same way it is available through anthropology. Let us regard this here as the circumscription and containment of the suffering Other. But the suffering Other demands something from us; their gaze seems to demand a recognition of their otherness notwithstanding our only recourse for doing so often being the reduction of their suffering into something that can be represented. For, it is frequently outside our power to immediately alleviate their suffering. A flawed representation is how we can take their suffering seriously, keep it open and make space for excess. Though this entails the generation of an image – the only means we have of representing otherness is inherently reductive – we have means of keeping the image open and allowing space within our representations for an ‘and’. The And is sacred and can never be resolved. The And can only be tolerated through a unidirectional and radically immanent mode, which is an image that has not yet folded back to become an image-object, which is an unresolved image-event, which is a transcendental image, which is a new anthropological image, which is a videogame.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="249" class="position" href="m.html#249" title="Anthropology responds with reflexivity.">249</a></div>

<div>Anthropology has taken the problem of representing otherness very seriously, but its standard response has been reflexivity and positioning — these are philosophical responses. Representation is still a preoccupation here, reflexivity’s purpose is to allow the reader to discern the anthropologist’s baggage, to convey an accurate context or look past the baggage altogether towards a clearer ethnographic image. Researchers also bracket their studies to only tackle a portion of the human phenomenon in question, only claiming to point towards the experience of the Other, recounting a dialogic situation and never claiming to capture the Other in its totality. But this restraint is couched on philosophical or political grounds which position anthropology to enjoy a moral superiority, via the decolonisation of thought, auto-ethnography, post-humanism, etc. This is all evoked as a kind of compensation or apology for our insufficient means of presenting some human phenomenon to the world. However, rather than apologise, anthropology only needs to play itself in the same way we play videogames; it only needs to concern itself with performing its image-event, creatively, in a non-violent way. Rather than colonising its colonialist past, it can assume a posture that invites others into new performances of the human, where representations of otherness are mere occasional phenomena. The representation is a non-violence because we are not done with it, it is only along the way, and redemption lies in the And.</div>

<div>Unlike cinema or ethnography, in which the genius of the art form lies in overcoming the capturing and reductive gesture of the camera or method, videogames are open by default. We play a role in the generation of the violent image explicitly, but the image is always unresolved. There is no claim to totalisation, except for what videogames borrow from other media because the image being generated always holds some potentiality, some secret, something incomprehensible that can only be revealed through its relation to the next image. And this next image can never be anticipated, even by the game developers, at least during gameplay. Even when a cutscene happens, what follows it is open and unresolved. A film can be an object that is static, it has completed its becoming and all it needs is a viewer. Of course, there are many possible interpretations of a film and in that sense, it is dynamic, but not so next to a videogame. A videogame is an event and violent images in videogames, though they can be just as reductive as any violent image when considered as an object, are acts of imaging. They are a process of the player orienting themselves in relation to the phenomenon of violence in the abstract sense.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="251" class="position" href="m.html#251" title="Videogames preserve the And.">251</a></div>	

<div>This is not how videogames are typically regarded, not only because of discourse external to the event but because the image-event itself is in no way obliged to convey its essence to itself. Videogames do not need to produce an experience that encourages an alignment with their essence, especially when their constituents coalesce towards the assumption of a closed image. Nevertheless — this is our creative response in <em>this</em> image-event to the phenomena of the violent image — the gaze of the suffering other means that each party contributing to the event ought to preserve and show reverence towards the And. I say ‘preserve’ because the And is present in the fundamental gesture of videogames, as actions. Inasmuch as videogames have adopted techniques of capture from other mediums, they must also perform a creative apology. That is, the means of capture and representation need to be problematized. But, of course, this is going to take place in a radically different way to other mediums, because those participating in the event that is a videogame do not have the option of regarding the image-event as an object to be critiqued or made more complicated through historical positioning or philosophical decision. Anyone who tries to do this is no longer talking about videogames (at least not according to the image we have been generating) but is describing mere image-objects with little to contribute and they have not redeemed the violent videogame image. Rather, our own participation in the production of images needs to be mobilized, to liberate the deployment of new image techniques, new ways of performing the same image-event so that it is no longer a representation and representation is no longer our goal. This can also mean problematizing our sense of self within the image-event, so that we are no longer its centre but becoming with/as the event. Since the beginning, since Zork <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Anderson et al. <a href="5.html#Anderson 1977" target="_blank" title="Anderson T, Blank M, Lebling D and Daniels B (1977) Zork [videogame]">1977</a>)</span>, role-playing videogames have allowed us to perform other identities. Our response to videogame violence can be an extension of this mode, towards the performance of situations and events at the cost of our centred identities.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="252" class="position" href="m.html#252" title="Videogames are played before they are interpreted.">252</a></div>	

<div>There are an infinite number of ways to play any videogame and <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is no exception. Beyond the particularities associated with how a player uses their hands to manipulate the image on the screen, how they push the buttons on the controller, this also encompasses everything players give to the videogame as an event, as a dialogic situation unfolding which they are only a part of. Many who have played <em>Part II</em>, interpreted their experience as an orientation towards a nihilistic stance in relation to the world, or that the game’s message is hopelessness <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Tolbert <a href="5.html#Tolbert 2020" target="_blank" title="Tolbert S (3 July 2020) ‘The Last of Part 2’s ending is a broken tale of nihilistic indulgence’">2020</a>; Myers <a href="5.html#Myers 2020" target="_blank" title="Myers M (12 June 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part 2 review: We’re better than this’">2020</a>)</span>. This is what they understand Naughty Dog to be trying to do to them and is a reflection of the style by which the game was played. That is to say, Naughty Dog is not the sole author of the experience and these interpretations of the game event reflect those player’s contributions to the videogame’s becoming. Of course, the interpretation of a text or image always reveals something about the person doing the interpretation. So, what does this say about <em>Part II</em> as a videogame, beyond the fact that videogames have the potential to throw this feature of art criticism into relief? Only that imaging violence is a shared responsibility, which neither those who are representing nor those who encounter the representation can fully live up to on their own. For, in videogames it becomes obvious that we all participate in the process of representation – we all participate in that violence. But we can leave our images open, thus maintaining the irreducibility of violence, when images are no longer objects, but unresolved performances. This is something videogames, like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, are teaching us how to do.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="253" class="position" href="m.html#253" title="This is expressed in Part II’s narrative.">253</a></div>

<div>And the final cut-scene of the game encouraged my own awareness of this when Ellie says to Joel – confronting him as the character who, we might say, represents the responsibility of every violent image produced in the series – to Joel, the personification of violence: ‘I don’t think I can ever forgive you for that… but I’m willing to try’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Druckmann et al. <a href="5.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. The openness and unresolved nature of this statement is what enables the redemption of Ellie as a character. But she is also an invitation for how to perform the game, for there is always a ‘New Game’ to be selected in the menu, and there is always new meaning to be given to the next violent image we are working to produce.</div>

<div>There is a videogame I have not played, a text I have not written... yet. These entail an image. And it will always be the next image. It will show me the Real as it is, it is an event I will perform towards an object, with a commitment and ambition equal to Hegel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>)</span> Absolute Knowing. But it is always the next image and for that reason, it is showing me how I am violent and is teaching me how to love. I never know what it will look like and a part of me is always striving for it to be the last; this striving is my fear, it is a stillness, it is a violence. But every time I look outside myself that fear receives a reply: ‘Not yet’.</div>
