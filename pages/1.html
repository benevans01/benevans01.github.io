<div  aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="001" class="position" href="m.html#001" title="The videogame is complex to describe.">001</a></div>	

<div>To play a videogame, a person concentrates their attention on a panel of flashing lights while holding a controller or while resting their hands on a table, over a mouse and keyboard. There needs to have been at least one developer, which is the person who has anticipated this, the player’s posture. Between the player and developer, we can isolate two more elements: hardware and additional software. Concerning hardware, we might describe what its design and commodification contribute to the videogame event. With additional software – e.g. the operating system, game engine, drivers, etc. – the event becomes more cumbersome to represent and analyse. This is because each software instance, once considered, creates a new developer vis-à-vis player situation. A multitude of people – development teams with directors, designers, artists, programmers, etc. – are usually involved and manifest in the image. They have anticipated and responded to this labour performed by the player or user. In this way, each choreographed and automated computer process that is necessary for the gaming event to occur, forms an overwhelmingly complex and genealogical matrix. A complete description of this mere experience – picks up the controller, ‘I'm going to play some <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Gavin et al. <a href="5.html#Gavin 1996" target="_blank" title="Gavin A, Rubin J, Siller D, Zembillas C and Pearson J (creators) (1996) Crash Bandicoot [videogame]">1996</a>)</span>’ – entails a detailed history of computing, untangling the authorship of layers of code from binary to a ‘custom LISP dialect’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Gavin <a href="5.html#Gavin 2011" target="_blank" title="Gavin A (25 October 2011) ‘Lispings ala John McCarthy’">2011</a>:para.3)</span>, directed entirely at the conveyance of a singular image, with all its particularities – that time I defeated Dr. Neo Cortex.</div>

<div>This project will only fulfil a part of what I have just described, but there are other ways to regard the human event that is a videogame. I will demonstrate some of these presently. I call these specific descriptions or representations of the human being <em>images</em>, in the same way I have described this entire document to be an image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="003" class="position" href="m.html#003" title="First image: what videogames look like.">003</a></div>

<div>Our first type of human image is the most obvious and the first one we experience, often before playing a game (to behold it is like being yelled at). I have embedded examples of these images throughout the website. Their emergence is ubiquitous across videogames as a medium; they are what videogames look like. They are pixelated, rasterized or ray-traced images of human (humanoid) characters killing, dying, solving problems, jumping, suffering, eating food, etc. (this list is in order of prevalence). We can produce similar images here, with this text you are reading and this image you will open and play: <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo2()" id="btn2">OPEN</button> 
    <script>
        function toggleVideo2() {

            var button = document.getElementById('btn2');
            if (video.style.display === 'none') {

                button.textContent = 'CLOSE';
            } else {
                video.style.display = 'none';

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="004" class="position" href="m.html#004" title="Second image: to think with videogames.">004</a></div>

<div>We can distinguish another type of human image from what we just experienced at <a href="#003" title="First image: what videogames look like." target="_blank">003</a>, which is less obvious. This second image can demand a great deal from those who participate in its emergence, that is, from those who participate in the event which generates it. It is not immediately given and the spectacle of the first image, as we just saw, creates resistance to the second’s actualisation. The second image takes work to pull out and convey to ourselves or others. While the first image evinces the representation/capture of a human, the second evinces a thought event with the human. For us this means, in the wake of <a href="#003" title="First image: what videogames look like." target="_blank">003</a>, beyond that sample of what is an endless supply of visual images of people doing things, we can <em>think with</em> videogames to generate images of <em>the</em> human or humanity. This can be done in reference to specific instances and I will provide three examples.</div>
	<ol>		
		<li><em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> gives us an image of the possibilities of human coordination and anatomy through the input commands of special moves like Ryu’s Shoryuken</a>. This human image emerges from thinking about game mechanics and input commands.</li>
		<li>The story of <em>The Last of Us</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Straley and Druckmann <a href="5.html#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>)</span> performs a reversal of Christian atonement and eschatology to probe the problem of evil and human suffering. This human image is identified in narrative and themes.</li>

	</ol>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="005" class="position" href="m.html#005" title="The videogame can leverage an image of humanity.">005</a></div>

<div>We can also be less specific by posing the question of the human to videogames in general. The gamer might be a bricoleur where ‘… the rule of his game is always to make do with “whatever is at hand”’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Lévi–Strauss <a href="5.html#Lévi–Strauss 1962" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1962/2021) Wild thought: a new translation of la pensée sauvage">1962/2021</a>:21)</span>, or videogames might expand the possibilities of our sense of self, extending the ‘horizon within which I am capable of taking a stand’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:27)</span>. And all these are to show how we might generate novel ways of considering humanity via the videogame, for each instance of a videogame can be made to speak to the question of human possibility and the phenomenon of videogames as a whole, represents a human striving for new possibility spaces.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="006" class="position" href="m.html#006" title="First and second image types are differentiated as degrees of abstraction.">006</a></div>

<div>This second type of videogame image — which I just demonstrated in the above theoretical extensions of the videogame towards an image of the human or humanity — these are of another order relative to the loud and stimulating human images of the first type at <a href="#003" title="First image: what videogames look like." target="_blank">003</a>. My examples of the first type are images I generated through playing videogames. I recorded the footage using this HDMI video capture card, which I purchased on eBay <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#eBay n.d." target="_blank" title="eBay Inc. (n.d.) eBay [website]">n.d.</a>)</span> for $15.95:</div>

My examples of the second type are images I generated later, after the fact, play, dialogue, capture, question and creative contemplation of the first type, in reference to the human condition. Beyond playing videogames, I generated these second images as ideas and associations to demonstrate the portrayal of what could be called a second-order human image, i.e. the fruition (image) of a thought-event that emerges from an image-event (the image-event being a videogame or videogames).</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="007" class="position" href="m.html#007" title="Videogames and anthropology think and perform human images.">007</a></div>

<div>Videogames entail and make possible certain styles of thought, unique to the phenomenon, as ‘a becoming’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Bergson <a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1907/2015) Creative Evolution">1907/2015</a>:170)</span> with other human agents. In the same way, anthropology can be said to tend towards its own unique ways of thinking and dialogue. And anthropology entails an image of the human (i.e. the ethnography) that is radically different from what is presented in videogames. Nevertheless, both entail the performance of what I call an <em>image-event</em>. I make an effort throughout this document not to favour an anthropological image or way of thinking over the videogame, as a separate and unique mode of orienting us with the human. Like anthropology, videogames are to think and perform an image of the human.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="008" class="position" href="m.html#008" title="What this website is: a new anthropological image.">008</a></div>

<div>I have called this document/website an image and here, at this early stage, it is appropriate to state exactly what it is an image of. It is both an image of the videogame and the human (an anthropological image) to the same extent. Because I will argue the videogame to be a human event, it is not inaccurate to say, more simply, that this document is an image of the human. But the videogame will require and inspire us to find new ways of doing anthropology, which is why I say it is a <em>new anthropological image</em>.</div>
<br>
<h2>1-2 Three ways</h2>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="009" class="position" href="m.html#009" title="Think of this project as three ways.">009</a></div>

<div>I will explain this project three times: twice in a small way and once in a big way (this entire website is the big way). These explanations can be thought of as three performances or image-events. More than an introduction, body and conclusion, I give three separate images of the same human event. All three explanations are mere attempts at pointing to events, and all do not succeed in capturing the whole of those events to the same extent, in a way that is infinite. But they are also all events in themselves, as performances of writing, reading, playing and watching. Each explanation moves from the former orientation pertaining to the performance’s (and other events which constitute an image) failure to capture the videogame event to the latter orientation, which pertains to the performance as an irreducible event in itself. We will now perform the intention for this project in the first instance of what I have called a ‘small way’ (the big way has already started).</div>
<br>
<h2>1-3 The videogame as human event</h2>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="010" class="position" href="m.html#010" title="The videogame is an event, not a representation.">010</a></div>

<div>All of the images described above can be viewed as reductions of an event; none of them perfectly convey the experience of what it is like to play a videogame or to participate in the videogame image. If our objective is a perfect conveyance of the human videogame experience, it would be better for readers to simply play a videogame and not read any further (I recommend <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ito <a href ="5.html#Ito 2000" title="Ito H (director) (2000) Final fantasy ix" target="blank">2000</a>)</span>). This is an essential distinction for what follows. So far, we have seen how there are multiple ways of construing an image of (or with) the videogame, in addition to the videogame image itself. There are multiple ways of performing the reduction. Each one highlights different elements of the event or adopts different perspectives toward it; some of these are obvious while others take effort and creativity. Videogames draw attention to the inadequacy of all these images as aftermaths of an irreducible event (and also reveal images themselves to be events when they are regarded in a specific way; this is one of our objectives). Anyone who has played a videogame can feel the non-performance of that frame-by-frame reproduction of events (re)produced by my HDMI video capture card. While playing a videogame, the image-as-separate-object, notwithstanding its dazzling and crucial role in the experience of playing a videogame, is always subordinate to the image-as-experienced-event. Playing a videogame entails relinquishing the graphical computer-generated representational liquid-crystal photon object, so we can enter into a shared (pre)configured event with other humans via gaming consoles, computers, controllers, monitors, etc. In this way, videogames are the apotheosis of a new orientation the human is assuming with images; the image is an event, it is what we do, it is not a thing to be described or even that which describes or represents. I become with (I am) the image – the transcendental image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="011" class="position" href="m.html#011" title="Videogames make the image a performance, not an object.">011</a></div>

<div>In this way, the videogame is a burgeoning and evolving medium for images which betrays traditional concepts of the image, notwithstanding the content found in videogame images, and the discourse surrounding the videogame’s obsession with appraising image-objects. These modes should be insufficient for an anthropological treatment of videogames. An obvious anthropological question apropos of videogames should be something like, ‘How is the videogame changing humanity's orientation vis-à-vis images?’, and while this question will be addressed in what follows to varying extents, these will serve to support a more radical imperative, closer to the videogame as a phenomenon: describe the videogame-human-image-event. This description is the terminus of a process that consists in dismantling the concept of the image to reveal a series of complex human events. The image is, then, not an object separate from our means of understanding it. And I follow through on those epistemological implications here: the image is not a distinct phenomenon to be understood in different ways – from one perspective it is an object, from another it is an event – rather, different ways of thinking, positions or orientations will regard different events to be their image. What ‘image’ means is dynamic and signals a way of thinking. A familiar example would be how memories, projections and fantasies each involve different styles of thought, styles that precede their image and not the other way around. Descartes’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> philosophy frames our experience of the world as a series of images we receive via our sensory organs, but here experience is comprised of images because of the way Descartes thought about experience. This dualism does not describe how we usually orient ourselves with the events of daily life. Seeing someone fall off their bike, we move to check if they are okay and participate in that transpiring event; we do not consider it to be an image. The Cartesian image entails a particular way of thinking which separates the subject, as experiencer and decision maker, from external events. We establish a distance through the abstraction (construction) of an isolated sense of self, distinct from the suffering Other who fell off their bike: <button type="button" onclick="toggleVideo3()" id="btn3">OPEN</button>

And this video is not a videogame. And despite the philosophical and ideological context in which each videogame phenomena is couched, the videogame, as a medium, is to perform the image as a performance to perform and not as an object to behold — at least temporarily, at least while we are intently playing a videogame.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="012" class="position" href="m.html#012" title="The videogame will happen to anthropology.">012</a></div>

<div>Here is the point: playing a videogame, entails a forgetting of the image as a separate thing to be looked at; we enter into a becoming with the image as a human event. Thus, anthropology is Eros, sent to kill Psyche but the two will fall in love. It will happen like this: to approach videogames with anthropological concerns (videogames as human events, not objects) involves the conveyance of the image as an event – making the realism and spectacle of the image as an object recede in our descriptions, corresponding and in response to the way it recedes while, for example, battling Satsuki in <em>Demon’s Souls</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Moore <a href="5.html#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. To approach anthropology with videogame concerns thus entails a new anthropology detached from the image, a new anthropological performance. Anthropology and the videogame, these two lovers, will here (this is one of our objectives) rediscover themselves and unlock new potentialities through each other. This project is to let videogames happen to anthropology (and anthropology to videogames). Following what the videogame image invites us to do, we can find a new perspective that is a new plane of human possibility: a truly <em>new</em> image. It will be an image that is an event, a videogame, a process of thinking, a performance-image that is a description of some constituents of human experience, a description of the image <em>as</em> human experience, a shared performance of <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>, the reading and the writing and the playing – I got the idea playing videogames.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="013" class="position" href="m.html#013" title="Distinguishing the events of the image.">013</a></div>

<div id="1.3p4">This new dialogic image process can start by distinguishing the events which make up our conception of an image. These include (1) consuming an image, (2) producing an image and (3) the event which an image is of. These each still treat the image as an object in relation to some human process but remember this is only our starting point. Their more detailed description, the production of more complex depictions of the phenomena will reveal how, each of the three events taken in isolation, attaches their imagined and insufficient  image-object to one of the other three events for subsistence. For example, when I am (1) consuming an image, I regard the image, the thing I am beholding, to emerge from either how the image was, or is, being produced or whatever the image is of. When you are in the process of (2) producing an image, by ‘I am making this image’ you mean you are creating some user/viewer experience for <em>consumption</em> or that you are <em>capturing</em> the likeness of some event which is more than your generative representation process can ever encompass. Finally, while we are concerned with (3) the event which an image is of, we are either not thinking about the image at all — we are like Heidegger’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heidegger 1927" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1927/2008) Being and time">1927/2008</a>:98)</span> carpenter with a hammer, immersed in their labour — or we are regarding the experience’s failure, via production or consumption, to encompass the infinite nature of the non-image event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="014" class="position" href="m.html#014" title="The image as symptom of a performed position.">014</a></div>

<div>This is to demonstrate what is said at <a title="The image is not a distinct phenomenon to be understood in different ways – from one perspective it is an object, from another it is an event – rather, different ways of thinking, positions or orientations will regard different events to be their image." href="#011" target="_blank">011</a>, that what constitutes an image (and thus what we find after closer inspection) will depend on our position or the event we are currently engaged in. When the events constituting the image of each perspective are described, the image is revealed to be a collection of events. We will also find that producing the image, consuming the image and the event which an image is of, are not mutually exclusive, that they are in many ways equivalent and that the third event, whatever the image is of (which can also encompass the first two) is more, infinitely more, than whatever we could mean by ‘this image’. The videogame forces these three events to coalesce, for the videogame event is always all three at once, in the moment we are playing a videogame, and this is what makes the videogame a special human event leading to anthropology’s future infatuation and affair with the videogame, overcoming both parties most egregious vices.</div>

This is not because of a new perspective which reveals greater context. There is no redemption for our two image-generating technologies (videogames and anthropology) in these kinds of encompassing gestures: the significance of the image we open and play is reduced via its position in a larger context, we can see <em>more</em> than an image by virtue of the monitor and surrounding apparatus brought into focus, it is a <em>mere</em> image. Getting underneath the image-event is not enough because this only performs another reduction, generates another image, namely an image of the events of an image. The above footage shows us this. Rather, we will paint the image as both an event that reduces something and an irreducible event in itself by making explicit the dialogic image we, yes you, the reader, are making right now. Here, ‘reduction event’ refers not only to that which we accused the image of at <a href="#010" title="All of the images described in the first section of this page can be viewed as reductions of an event; none of them perfectly convey the experience of what it is like to play a videogame or to participate in the videogame image." target="_blank">010</a> — to regard/generate an enclosed image is to reduce and enclose an irreducible event — it also refers to the blatant reduction of suffering otherness expressed in the <em>Bioshock</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Levine <a href="5.html#Levine 2007" target="_blank" title="Levine K (2007) (director) Bioshock [videogame]">2007</a>)</span> footage, which is an image, not an aggregate. The images we must reframe into new image-events are those that constitute a particular stance of feigned non-participation; not playing a videogame, not producing an image by consuming it, not consuming an image by producing it, making the image be <em>of</em> some event with a totalising scope it will never fulfil. In the videogame image-event, the act of playing a videogame — in the performing of a <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Motomura <a href="5.html#Motomura 2018" target="_blank" title="Motomura J (director) (2018) Dragon Ball FighterZ [videogame]">2018</a>)</span> combo string — <em>there is no external event or object to be reduced</em>. Image (1) production, (2) consumption and (3) the event which an image is of, becomes a single performance or human event. The reduction event, as an act of orienting ourselves with ‘that image’ (an otherness reduced to finitude) is never the end product. It happens along the way into the event of the videogame image itself (or an anthropological image). Rather than objectively critiquing the image as a separate object, we reorient the image event by way of direct participation and say something like, <em>this is not over</em>. The performance of reduction is not attacked but creatively redeemed within the human imagination of the dialogic act of the videogame image-event, which we, as participants (players), are a part of.</div>

<!--footnote: any resistance to this process is philosophical-->
<div>There is an irreverence to the juxtaposition of the above videogame images with the anthropological ones. But the videogame image will become less trivial and the anthropological image will become more of a participation and more of a playing. And the videogame images are fictional unlike the scholarly images, but they all entail a performance that is some kind of a participation in the general phenomenon that is violence and the human condition. Further, as actors negotiating and in contact with the otherness of suffering, we are compelled to continue to correct our failed representations that trail behind our disparate, desperate engagements; we do not need to keep playing <em>Bioshock</em> necessarily but as we <em>will</em> keep generating images, we will keep participating in image-events. We seek to overcome all resistance to this process (this is one of our objectives) and affirm a shared responsibility, bestowed by the haunting and incomprehensible otherness we experience through the set of events we regard as an image, to <em>make another image</em>.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="018" class="position" href="m.html#018" title="On the redemption of a shared (open) image.">018</a></div>

<div>And our source of greatest redemption is that we are not alone in these endeavours. I feel this now and you should too. For example, I have described this text as an image which is a signification of my stance as its author. I, as author, am not in a position to redeem this document from its failings to accurately represent what I have set out to describe. But the act of reading can be regarded as a creative event in the same way my act of writing is. The instance of reading is where I must hope <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> can be redeemed, as an event which you are a part of and which you make unfinished. We read texts and participate in images in new ways, we extend them as dialogic events, to redeem them; we condemn them and ourselves hypocritically, in contradictions and binaries, by framing a static image.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="019" class="position" href="m.html#019" title="This is the limit of the whole project.">019</a></div>

<div>And this is how far we will get in this document – that was a small way of performing what I hope to achieve here. The image, as a set of events, will not be described sufficiently for the gesture of this entire document until much later, until the various events which make up the image have been explored and described along a trajectory. The upshot of that trajectory occurs towards the end of the <a href="3.html" title="3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">third page</a> (chapter). I will now anticipate some elements of the experience of that page for my reader, to the extent that those elements are relevant to these early stages of <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> and my reader’s bearing of the whole.</div>

<div>The third page titled <a href="3.html" title="3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE</a> is to redeem the image-event in response to the line of thought to which that page is dedicated, where the image emerges in its most problematic state as a kind of violence. This framing emerges from an exploration of the events which constitute a videogame image, performed on the page before it, <a href="2.html" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE AS TRANSCENDENTAL" target="_blank">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a>. Here is a fast way into what this third and culminating page will do, though the actual performance will take the long route, viz. the entire document up to that point: abstracting the image into events invites several distinctions to be made: the difference between the image being conveyed through prose and the act of playing a videogame, between what is being displayed on the screen and the act of playing a videogame, between an image and the event that an image is of, between an image of an actor pretending to be shot in the head, a rasterized image of someone being shot in the head, an image that is a recording of someone being shot in the head, <button aria-hidden="true" type="button" onclick="toggleVideo6()" id="btn6">OPEN</button>

The historical footage of an actual event of violence makes that rasterized and pretended violence of the videogame image seem fake and trivial. This is one way to think of it, and it is the way I thought things would go before I edited the above video. However, now that it is here, my experience of this image is unexpected, though I can only speak for myself. I played a larger role in the making of this image than my reader, so I am differently oriented, which might be why I see the influence these images have on each other in the reverse. That is, the image of an execution I performed in <em>Part II</em> is <em>not</em> made to feel less real as a result of its juxtaposition to the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém. <em>Part II's</em> violence could not be made less real for me. At no stage during my playing of the game, or watching or editing the recording, did I assume a real execution was transpiring or had transpired in reference to that image of Ellie shooting an NPC (non-player character). Rather, <em>Part II</em> brings the captured war footage into alignment with it, as another mere image, another futile attempt at conveying the termination (or explosion) of otherness that occurs when a bullet passes through someone’s brain. Being in a position to manipulate the image, feeling the burden of being someone who produces the violent image (as one is, while playing a videogame), changes our orientation towards the image. The image is then of the process we went through to produce it more than it is of the event it is supposed to represent. <em>Part II</em> has more colour and detail, but we, as viewers, bring different contexts to how we experience the image. The Vietnam footage is more violent because we know it really happened, that Nguyễn Văn Lém and Major General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan were real people. But if we are explicitly producing the image and are aware of our contributions to it, we do not put faith in the concealed movements of a camera, we know where the image came from, and that any image can only point towards some irreducible human event, which it cannot encompass. Someone passes in front of the camera, just as Nguyễn Ngọc Loan pulls the trigger, we have only this angle, we have only this many frames, this resolution, such distance, the list goes on forever; we have everything there is to work with, we can slow things down or zoom in, insert a more realistic gunshot sound, add ambiance, place it next to some other image and see how that changes our experience, we tailor an experience. To make the image of the begging NPC, I killed all his friends and then shot him in the hand to disarm him — that’s when they start to beg — and I made that image of violence just for the sake of this paragraph and to experience and contrast rasterization and film in a single violent image. The association established in that video works to invalidate the associating of either image with a violent event. Both images fail to represent real violence. We might have already known this about the videogame image, but now the historical image is there too. I put it in the video.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="022" class="position" href="m.html#022" title="The videogame event cannot represent violence.">022</a></div>

<div><a href="3.html" title="3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE</a> will express a concern for the image’s failings in this regard, irrespective of the image’s source (videogame, camera or otherwise), namely the image’s universal failure to encompass the irreducible event of violence. The event that is the experience of the image (consumption) and the event which generates the image (production) will have been dealt with earlier for their own sakes on the <a href="2.html" title="2 VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL" target="_blank">second page</a>. The <a href="3.html" title="3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">third page</a> will address the image’s claims that it is of some event beyond the image, specifically violence. In this way, the violent event that an image is of can be thought of as the object of the image’s intrusion and that which the image occludes. The violent image — as something to behold and as a concept — is the performance of, or participation in, an event that reduces and hides the event of suffering otherness through the process of production and consumption, the event/s of the image. We disassociate the violent image from the violent event, via videogames, in response to this hostile gesture. This allows the violent image to be framed as a dynamic event for us, rather than a thing to behold; it can be a way of perpetually orienting ourselves with the Other and human suffering. As an event, we can regard the violent image’s claims to have captured or conveyed otherness as but one orientation, and we can find an unfinished, less reductive bearing with videogames. This bearing was described in the <a href="#010" title="1-3 The Videogame as Human Event" target="_blank">previous section</a>. However, that section’s succinctness does not embroil us into the problematic of the violent image, as the culmination of a description of the image as an event.</div>

The image as an object (Sam or V’s reflection above, that which is on our screen) is what we are seeking to point beyond - to eventually disclose the image as an irreducible event in itself and not ‘a representation… [which] has its actual existence in something other than itself’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Hegel <a href="5.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>:273)</span>.

<div>This is not a distinction Baudrillard <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:1)</span> made in his description of simulacra, as ‘the generation by models of a real without origin or reality’. Baudrillard describes our postmodern saturation in images as essentially non-specific pertaining to the real. Contrarily, we start from an imperative to convey something that is more than an image, and which could be described as specifically real compared to an image, especially in relation to violent images like the ones generated at <a href="#003" title="We can produce similar images here, with this text you are reading and this image you will open and play..." target="_blank">003</a> (images of humans in videogames), <a href="#015" title="The act of gameplay invites us to think in different terms, the videogame’s terms, which can redeem our participation in image-events..." target="_blank">015</a> (harvesting a Little Sister), <a href="#016" title="...or in the violence we have failed to represent in this image..." target="_blank">016</a> (Igor’s failed suicide attempt) or <a href="#020" title="...a rasterized image of someone being shot in the head, an image that is a recording of someone being shot in the head..." target="_blank">020</a> (two violent images, rasterized and filmed). In this mode, an event is real compared to its image regardless of that image’s ambitions to simulate, or successes in simulating, any aspect of the Real. Regarding the motivations behind and decisions in writing <a href="3.html" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">page 3</a>, as the upshot of this process, we commence with a concern for that which has been recorded (not the recording), in the case of actual documented events. An example of this is the final clip at <a href="#020" title="...a rasterized image of someone being shot in the head, an image that is a recording of someone being shot in the head..." target="_blank">020</a> in which Nguyễn Ngọc Loan famously kills Nguyễn Văn Lém. In the case of fictional images, like those found in films and videogames, the event we refer to is that which is being portrayed (not the portrayal). Ellie is a fictional character but the concepts of death, murder, human suffering, etc. are still being portrayed and reduced in the above gameplay footage. My first drafts of <a href="3.html" title="3 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE" target="_blank">page 3</a> intended to describe the events as more real than (existing independently from) the images which portray or capture them. This moves against Baudrillard’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6)</span> hyperreal, i.e. the rejection of ‘any distinction between the real and the imaginary’. If a simulacrum ‘has no relation to any reality whatsoever’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Baudrillard <a href="5.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6)</span>, there are no pure simulacra here, for we will exhaust the description of images down into their real events with videogames. This, in a sense, is to reframe our contributions to the image in a way that allows the image to become real, a performance. There is always a connection to an irreducible event, be it what is portrayed by the image of a headshot, the gameplay event that is captured or the pretended ‘capture’ itself.</div>

We need this initial critique to affirm something beyond the text itself, beyond the image being produced by the author. For example, Kant’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> noumena, Wittgenstein’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:89)</span> ‘what we cannot speak about’ and Gabriel Marcel’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:55-56)</span> meta-problematic, are thought of as fulfilling this role in their respective philosophical systems or styles. Dilworth refers to this apparently necessary limiting case as simplicity: ‘I say that I think something is completely simple, only because I have really nothing to say of it than merely that it is something’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kant cited in Dilworth <a href="5.html#Dilworth 2013" target="_blank" title="">2013</a>:15)</span>. Without this kind of critique with its implicit parameters (viz. a reaching for something which is not to be described in the last instance, something which does not and cannot reside within the text itself, Shestov’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Shestov 1916" title="Shestov L (1916) Penultimate words and other essays" target="_blank">1916</a>)</span> last word) there is a lack of significance to whatever occurs and is accomplished.

We always need some infinite concept beyond the text or beyond the image, which overflows it, not only for the image to be about but for which to perform.<span><input type="checkbox" id="footnote-toggle-2" class="footnote-toggle"><label class="footnote" for="footnote-toggle-2" aria-hidden="true"><sup>2</sup></label><div class="footnoteText" id="fn-2"> And before this is over we will reverse our entire way of regarding this issue, so that it is no longer ‘the unconditioned limiting the phenomena but rather of the unconditional phenomenal itself determining and limiting thought’ (Laruelle <a href="5.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:257).</div></span> On this, we do not need to be specific, beyond separating it from the events of the image, for it is simply the event-which-an-image-is-of.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="026" class="position" href="m.html#026" title="This image is an invitation towards the Real.">026</a></div>

<div>More than a clarification of this project’s scope and mission — i.e. to establish the pursuit of something beyond what is reproduced by my HDMI video capture card — this distinction between image and event, and the assertion that an image like this one has the potential to point towards and invite readers into an event, that this image itself can be regarded as such, is necessary to justify the project to itself. Otherwise, I might just give my reader a few hundred hours of gameplay footage to watch, it being a perfect replication of the event in one narrow sense. But I have designed the image that is this document to be more than a Let’s Play and more than an example of Gillen’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Gillen 2004" target="_blank" title="Gillen K (23 March 2004) 'The new games Journalism', Kieron Gillen's workblog">2004</a>)</span> ‘new dogma… 1) The worth of gaming lies in the gamer not the game. 2) Write travel journalism to Imaginary Places’ – no; this image will perform an explicit invitation towards the Real, i.e. towards an inter-human event, even as this document can be regarded as an event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="027" class="position" href="m.html#027" title="This image is an extension of videogame performance.">027</a></div>

<div>Of course, every image is an invitation to the event of its consumption, be it a dialogic and creative consumption or otherwise. Within the parameters of its text, this document is an invitation to the former, to regard the reading of it as a means of participating in a human event. Beyond what can be contained in text and recordings of gameplay footage, it is also an invitation to think with and play videogames, to think about the human through videogames in new and unprecedented ways, which extend beyond the scope of this project. For, as I have said, what I produce here, from my perspective, is a mere image. That is, I am reducing two events, the act of this document being read and the real event I am trying to describe, to perform the gesture of writing it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="028" class="position" href="m.html#028" title="This page concerns image production and consumption.">028</a></div>	

<div>The <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">second page</a> of this document, titled <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a>, is dedicated to the other two events we associated with the image at <a href="#013" target="_blank" title="This new dialogic image process can start by distinguishing the events which make up our conception of an image.">013</a>, namely consuming and producing the videogame image. In one sense, we could say these two events <em>are</em> the image, they are the image happening, they <em>subsist</em>. While the event-which-an-image-is-of exists independent of its reduction into an image, these two events begin – this is the state in which we find them – as the performance of that reduction. Further, they are first recognised as constituents of the image; they share a naive genesis with the image, as a thing to be described, of which they are a part.</div>

<div>The first drafts of this <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">second page</a> came out of an intention to describe a part of the videogame image in preparation for the real human event of videogames, to be described later. However, the process of writing, and all that that entails, uncovered these ‘parts’ of the image as human events in their own right. We can think of, then, the image-as-problematic-object-to-be-described’s retreat into the <a href="3.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE">third page</a>, where it is destroyed or where the whole image becomes a set of events for us. So, <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a> is to discover the first two elements of the image as complex <em>dialogic</em> and <em>embodied</em> events; a setting out to describe the image only to discover events.</div>

<div>This is how we get to the problem of violence, the violence of beholding and reducing the suffering Other, addressed on the <a href="3.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME EVENT, AS NON-VIOLENCE">third page</a>. The image, as an event we orient our bodies towards, is stimulating because of the way it can occlude that process; the body of the beholder is concealed in the image. The image pulls us away from our bodies towards a Cartesian abstraction. This abstraction is not the by-product of consuming an image but how the image is experienced, how it is generated. This also entails our passing over and dismissing the body of the suffering Other, an otherness that cannot be replicated with pixels, a suffering that can only be seen by placing ourselves, our bodies, in its path.</div>

<div>The role of the body in the event of consuming the image is also how the image is produced, for we enter an event with the image’s author, fulfilling what they have anticipated. In videogames, this event becomes explicitly dialogic and radically unresolved. <a href="2.html" target="_blank" title="2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL">2 THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE, AS TRANSCENDENTAL</a> uses <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Funamizu et al. <a href="5.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="5.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="5.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="5.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="5.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span> to discover the inter-human dialogic event in the phenomenon of the image.

It was not Lienhardt’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>)</span> place to formulate some new conception of the master of the fishing spear’s spears, after all. The spears, as formulated by the Dinka, contributed to Lienhardt’s descriptions of one instance of humanity orienting itself with Divinity or ultra-human forces. This is in the same way the shrine and spears, conveyed in an example of Lienhardt’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> famous photography, were constituents of an image of the human, forming an essential part of that image, with the mother and child standing over to the left… </div>

</figure>
<div>The problem would then be to position the videogame, as a cultural object, in relation to the human, to form a new image. This is how Thornham’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Thornham 2011" target="_blank" title="Thornham H (2011) Ethnographies of the videogame: gender, narrative and praxis">2011</a>:10)</span> Ethnographies of the Videogame is positioned, where ‘interviews, reflections, and the recordings of gameplay’ in eleven UK households, constitute her entire methodological gesture. <em>Playing</em> a videogame to understand the human, as participant observation, as ethnographic engagement, is not conceived as part of Thornham’s project. In discussions surrounding the videogame’s legitimacy as art <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Golding <a href="5.html#Golding 2011" target="_blank" title="Golding D (2011) ‘Not art you say?: in defence of videogames’">2011</a>; Ndi <a href="5.html#Ndi 2019" target="_blank" title="Ndi A (2019) ‘Rethinking video games in critical discourse: re-visiting intersections of the ICT hypertext and artistic consumption’">2019</a>)</span>, the game is positioned as an artwork, even when nobody is playing it. In these cases, including Thornham’s, the videogame is a thing to be grasped, appraised, analysed, etc. A distance is presupposed and a comparability and containment are bestowed upon human experience to generate specimens.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="037" class="position" href="m.html#037" title="But the videogame is not an object.">037</a></div>

<div>But this is counter to what I find is most interesting and valuable in a study of videogames and ignores what makes them unique. So much for defining and describing videogames: videogames discourage these objectifications in the act of playing them. It is only after the fact or before it, when the game is not happening, that we can imagine it as a static phenomenon to be defined, critiqued, and compared to other instances of the videogame or even other art forms.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="038" class="position" href="m.html#038" title="There is an agency to the videogame event.">038</a></div>

<div>But anthropology’s greatest contributions to the videogame, and the videogame’s greatest contributions to anthropology, will not be found in a style of thought focused on the definition, function or appraisal of a new cultural object. When the videogame is regarded as a thing to be understood, it is essentially extraneous to our application of the anthropological question (What is the human being? <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Kant <a href="5.html#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538)</span>), the question we seek here to apply to videogames. It is context, extra details, but not where we are pointing the question, not a human event of which the researcher can become a part. In this way, I suggest acknowledging an agency in the videogame, as a human event, as its own form of an answer to the anthropological question and as a new way of asking the question (contra Kant’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538)</span> way of asking the question).</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="039" class="position" href="m.html#039" title="The videogame is radically unresolved.">039</a></div>

<div>Videogames ought not to simply function within the social structure we ensconce them. In a way that is more obvious than film or any art form (the art status of videogames is tangential), videogames entail a performance with other actors, which makes them radically unresolved. Of course, we can say that everything is unresolved, but being unresolved is the videogame’s premise, its first principle, the starting point of our experience with the medium. I say videogames are radically unresolved because any other articulation ignores how they must be regarded to experience them; to perform the event we must regard this image as indeterminate. In the case of a film or novel, we can be oblivious to the indeterminate nature of the thing – the book is sitting on my desk; it is a static object. The videogame has parameters, the code, hardware, etc., but the goal is to hide these; they are what you forget to make the videogame happen, they recede to bring forth an event.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="040" class="position" href="m.html#040" title="Applications for this style of thought beyond videogames (excluding philosophy).">040</a></div>

<div>This means videogames can teach a style of thought which regards other mediums and thought projects to be events as well. For example, our explicit participation in the production of a videogame-image can make clear our implicit participation in the cinema, the ‘movement-image’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Deleuze <a href="5.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span>. Compared to spears, shrines, paintings, films, and even some interpretations of anthropology, videogames are still in the making in a more obvious sense. And this can constitute a useful thought exercise we might apply beyond the videogame. It can lead us to think dialogically, towards a pregnant otherness, regarding things as not having fully happened yet and no instance of happening is identical. This is an aside and not a philosophical argument, we do not use videogames to do an ontology. The videogame demands a new way of thinking which philosophy is insufficient for, but this will have to be qualified much later on the <a href="4.html" target="_blank" title="4 THE VIDEOGAME, AS PASSAGE TO NON-STANDARD THOUGHT">fourth page</a>, which will serve as our conclusion.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="041" class="position" href="m.html#041" title="Identical screen states constitute different events.">041</a></div>

<div>The videogame is unresolved, but of course, there are identical screen states. The context and role of those states in the unfolding dialogue between player, developer and device are never the same. When I spawned into <em>Demon's Souls'</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Moore <a href="5.html#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> Shrine of Storms at Black World Tendency for the forty-third time, the screen’s pixels assumed exactly the same state as the first time, but it was not the same.  Playing a videogame and reflecting on the event itself discourages determining articulations in a way that is only comparable to other software, dialogue, ritual, societies or the world.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="042" class="position" href="m.html#042" title="The videogame is not a location.">042</a></div>

<div>And by ‘the world’ here I mean everything, that is, ‘all that is the case’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Wittgenstein <a href="5.html#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:5)</span>, because this project does not treat videogames as visitable locations in which social phenomena transpire. They are not the <em>scene</em> from Lienhardt’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> photo in which the mother and child happen to be standing over to the left, in which the anthropologist has the opportunity to capture their unique position, their way of being in the world.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="043" class="position" href="m.html#043" title="Examples of the videogame as fieldsite.">043</a></div>

<div>This is the more common position among social or cultural anthropologists, with the proviso that the videogame or similar is continuously online, so as to entail social continuity and meet Boellstorff’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>:740; <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span> criteria for a ‘virtual world’. Some examples of such ethnographies include Taylor’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>)</span> <em>Play Between Worlds: Exploring Online Game Culture</em>, Boellstorff’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>)</span> own, <em>Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human</em>, Nardi's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>)</span> <em>My Life as a Night Elf Priest: An Anthropological Account of World of Warcraft</em>, Rowlands' <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>)</span> <em>Video Game Worlds: Working at Play in the Culture of EverQuest</em> and Sundén and Sveningsson's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Sundén 2012" target="_blank" title="Sundén J and Sveningsson M (2012) Gender and sexuality in online game cultures: passionate play">2012</a>)</span> <em>Gender and Sexuality in Online Game Cultures</em>. But all these projects have entirely different objectives from the present one. That is, ethnographies like these are not anthropologies of the videogame; they are studies of, or with, the people who play videogames within a virtual world. Here, the videogame is accepted as a potential location in which social and cultural events can transpire. I do not directly dispute this assumption, but I do wish to point out that a more basic human event has been stepped over in the framing of the above projects, namely the videogame itself.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="044" class="position" href="m.html#044" title="Present axioms of anthropology miss the videogame, as new human event.

<div>The above projects have not questioned the videogame as a human event. They already have working conceptions of the videogame as a platform, which is evident in their methodologies, in how they regard ‘games like EverQuest [as] fundamentally social spaces’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>:10)</span>, an ‘online fieldsite’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:5)</span> from which to collect or generate data through ‘normal anthropological methods including participant observation and interviews’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:4)</span>.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="045" class="position" href="m.html#045" title="The videogame requires a radicalised and radically immanent anthropology.">045</a></div>

<div>If the videogame image was simply a cultural object or virtual fieldsite, we could just play <em>World of Warcraft</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dabiri and Guerrero <a href="5.html#Dabiri 2004" target="_blank" title="Dabiri S and Guerrero C (producers) (2004) World of warcraft [videogame]">2004</a>)</span> ourselves, do our own ‘frantic clicking [to] produce the salutary effect of killing the monster’, instead of reading Nardi's <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>:5)</span> account. A gentleman reading <em>Witchcraft, oracles, and Magic Among the Azande</em> at Oxford in the late 1930s had no way of consulting a poison oracle himself, for it was as the Zande said: ‘perhaps in their country people are not murdered by witches, but here they are’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Evans-Pritchard <a href="5.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>:221)</span>. ‘Here’, Zandeland, was Evans-Pritchard’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>)</span> privilege, and his research has value today as a historical document for that aspect alone, even without its potential applications / tacit identifications of ‘webs of meaning’ in Western systems of thought. But when anthropology is applied to the production of digital images like videogames, historical documentation of human expression is not an ancillary function/appeal that can distract us, we are here for something else, some other type of image. Here, the theoretical picture becomes essential and Rowlands’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:157)</span> description of a Durkheimian division of labour in <em>EverQuest</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(McQuaid <a href="5.html#McQuaid 1999" target="_blank" title="McQuaid B (1999) EverQuest [videogame]">1999</a>)</span>, with its collectivist/individualist tensions and contradictions, is more important than descriptions of how the ‘enormous rhinoceroses wander obstinately across the horizon, accompanied by human-sized, golden-feathered cockatrices…’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rowlands <a href="5.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:57)</span>.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="046" class="position" href="m.html#046" title="This cannot be accomplished with auto-ethnography.">046</a></div>

<div>This is notwithstanding the auto-ethnographic value of a text too, where the ethnographic image is determined by and made subordinate to the researcher’s point of entry. This includes when the researcher’s subjectivity serves as the impetus for the framing of a sociological question, like in Sveningsson’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Sveningsson 2012" target="_blank" title="Sveningsson M (2012) ‘Go with your passion!’">2012</a>:22)</span> case, ‘how female gamers experience the games, gaming activities and gaming cultures, from their perspective as female gamers’. This less ambitious, more specific than it is transcendental (Kant’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:A12)</span> ‘transcendental’), more personal, style of question is not fundamentally reflexive towards the evolution of the human condition through videogames in the way I intend. Rather, a question is being applied to a predefined, determinate, instance of the human – that which we talk about when we talk about ourselves — not the human proper.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="047" class="position" href="m.html#047" title="These authors are not interested in videogames.">047</a></div>

<div>Considering all these examples, our negative apologia of anthropology’s orientation vis-à-vis the videogame comes to this: none of these authors know what a videogame is, and they are only interested in doing things with what a videogame is not  — and this is not to suggest we know what a videogame is, or even that we will ultimately constrain the videogame event in such a way as to define it (see <a href="2.html#071" target="_blank" title="The description of videogames in this way is counter to agendas that seek to define what a videogame is.">071</a>), only that we want to do something <em>with</em> it. These authors are doing anthropology while doing a videogame or doing anthropology with the people who play videogames while taking the videogame ‘as given’. In this way, they generate an image of the human, or perform a representation à la Lienhardt’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> photo of the woman and child standing over to the left, and instead of spears and a shrine there is a videogame or the videogame is where they are standing; here is the human (maybe a new and under-represented type) and here is the thing (maybe a new and under-represented type) and here is an image of the two and we can see what they have to do with each other, and understand each one better, and we have given each one a voice – the voice we had in mind.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="048" class="position" href="m.html#048" title="The videogame is both an image and an event (image-event).">048</a></div>

<div>And here are two problems: (1) the videogame is already an image without us giving anything to it at all and (2) the videogame, online social network or otherwise, is not an object or a place but an event. Ethnographies and anthropological engagements heretofore performed with the videogame in mind – and even outside any attempts at anthropological framing – prioritise the convenient application of familiar methodologies and theory over the fact that videogames entail a new human image-event.</div>
