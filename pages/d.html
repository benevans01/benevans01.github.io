<h1 align="center">Love is caprice (d)</h1>
<h2 align="center"><em>December 2019</em></h2>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d01" class="position" href="m.html#d01" title="Sam discovers a rope.">d01</a></div>
		
<div>Sam bends down and fastens a container of precious smart drugs onto his back <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(see Kojima <a href="5.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>)</span>. Rocky green hills stretch out before me and a dotted line overlays the scene indicating to Sam the path he is to traverse. As I begin down the slope in front of him, the heavy load of cargo rocks to one side and for a moment it seems that I am about to tumble down the slope and off the cliff up ahead. With the left trigger, Sam is able to regain his balance and come to a stop before the sheer drop. There is no way forward and backtracking is my only option. But Sam’s situation is suddenly jolted, and a new truth erupts into existence. I see that some stranger’s caprice has deposited a rope to allow for a safe descent. This is the chaos of the new and not the mere execution of preestablished code written in the game’s script. An actual individual, somewhere in the world, for reasons I will never know, saved me from a minor inconvenience. Regardless of that person’s intent, I am grateful to them, and it does not matter that they will never know. We are connected and I have done nothing but let it happen: ‘Let there be light’.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d02" class="position" href="m.html#d02" title="This is what ladders are for.">d02</a></div>
		
<div>A ladder can function as a bridge, allowing Sam to cross a deep chasm and deliver the packages. I do not need to collect the ladder once the crossing is complete and if Sam abandons it, the ladder will remain on the network, likely to be discovered and gratefully used by some random player I will never meet. It is difficult to tell if Sam will need to use the ladder at some future stage in my journey, but such inconveniences seem small compared to the thought of the relief a stranger might experience as a result of what we leave behind. So, for reasons not fully understood to us, we let it stay: ‘Let us make human-kind…’.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d03" class="position" href="m.html#d03" title="Love is open to the possibility of the other.">d03</a></div>
		
<div>This caprice is love. It is the same love Rosenzweig <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:218)</span> sees in ‘love your neighbour’, for the word ‘neighbour’ describes</div>
<blockquote class="small">the nearest neighbour… the one who is nearest to me, at least at this moment, regardless of what he may have been before or will be afterward. Thus, the neighbour is only a representative.</blockquote>
<div>It could and must be anyone, and there is a chaos to this any-person-whatever. The neighbour has earned nothing, they have stumbled into our path through entropy’s curtain and landed here, before us, and we can do something about them. or, rather, we can let ourselves be open to them and the possibility that is their being. The ladder does not care who finds it, for it has already been deposited. In the same way, love presupposes an other in the specific, nearest sense, but the contents of which are always open, full of potentiality into infinity.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d04" class="position" href="m.html#d04" title="Love rejects selective discrimination.">d04</a></div>
		
<div>This love cannot be selective because it embraces the chaos of uncertainty. The discrimination of selection is only justifiable in relation to the second nearest. This second nearest evokes a version of love that is void of spontaneity and creativity. It is a kind of love that poses no threat to the stability of the isolated self, it is convenient, comfortable and still. A gesture of compassion for the human or group ‘out there’, away from me, or present but too broad to become manifest as an individual which might disturb something inside me. I have chosen this as a cause that I can sympathise with: this is the initial gesture of the second nearest. The nearest, by contrast, commences as an event, an opening up to the universe. We enter into relation with an other and the contents of that other are open and that is the gesture.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d05" class="position" href="m.html#d05" title="Anthropology can be open to the nearest.">d05</a></div>

<div>This describes what it is to be an anthropologist. It is to recognise the Other in the any, to open oneself to that other as the nearest, the emerging human before us which we are experiencing at this moment. The selection of informants has nothing to do with anthropology, it is not necessarily prior to or a condition of thought towards the potentialities of the human. The forces that brought Evans-Pritchard <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>)</span> to sit in front a Zande, asking why they poisoned a chicken, are incidental. Our confrontation with the Other is its own isolated and spontaneous event, it is always new and cannot be planned.  In contrast, pursuit of an other that is far away and most radically different from oneself for its own sake is only to grasp at the second nearest. This second nearest is the least radical place to find an other, it confirms the Other as other and poses no threat to the self. Thus, it cannot grasp the emerging human because the second nearest is full of presuppositions and such is the violence that hedges up the self.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d06" class="position" href="m.html#d06" title="Love negates the self to find it in performance.">d06</a></div>
		
<div>Love is to give of oneself, to say ‘yes’ as a creative eruption negating the <em>no</em> of the self, to lose one’s life. Where are the ladders and ropes we left for the Other? We cannot be sure because we have lost them for the sake of that which ‘always erupts anew. It is a matter of always starting over from the beginning’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rosenzweig <a href="5.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:215)</span>. Over fifty hours of save data lays dormant in the game world, it describes a self and trajectory which could remain, a stillness that cost nothing and yet everything. A chaos erupts, a window into the aught suddenly becomes manifest in the form of a single question. 
<blockquote><span class="small">Do you have any interest in helping the week?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">Selecting this option enables you to save someone somewhere in the world. However, in exchange, you will lose all of your save data. Do you still wish to rescue someone — a total stranger — in spite of this?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">The person you save will be selected at random. As a result, this person who cries out for help even as we speak may be someone you intensely dislike. Do you still wish to help?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">You worked so hard to unlock Debug Mode and Chapter Select, but they will no longer be available to you. Do you... still wish to help?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">You may not receive thanks for your efforts. Some may say that your efforts are purely for show. Do you still wish to help?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">And you are truly — TRULY — sure about this?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="small">Very well. In exchange for all of your data I will convey your will to this world.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taro <a href="5.html#Taro 2017" target="_blank" title="Taro Y (director) (2017) Nier: Automata [videogame]">2017</a>)</span></blockquote>
The world is created again through deletion of the self. The past no longer presses down on the present, for past is past, the present is rebirth and the caprice of love rolls forth. The save file that was laboured for is the weight of the past.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d07" class="position" href="m.html#d07" title="Love embraces the past as creative material.">d07</a></div>
		
<div>This is not a rejection of the past. We need the past as something to give and surrender. Our past was full of love and we keep memories of love that teach us to love today,</div>
<blockquote><span class="small">…for no memories are more precious to a man than those of his earliest childhood in his parental home, and that is almost always so, as long as there is even a little bit of love and unity in the family. But from a very bad family, too, one can keep precious memories, if only one’s soul knows how to seek out what is precious.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Dostoevsky <a href="5.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:290)</span></blockquote>
<div>But for love to exist in the here and now, between us and the other who finds us today, we must act what is unprecedented in the mutual generation of the new – that is what the past should teach us. In other words, we must be disturbed. The history of anthropology is filled with insight stained with the violence of colonialism, but we know those stains are not anthropology. The past was a spontaneous event of love – someone left a rope for us – and as such is the source of our salvation. But refusing to leave a ladder bridge behind because we want to preserve the landscape, clinging to a tradition, that is the stillness of violence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="d08" class="position" href="m.html#d08" title="Relationships are creative acts.">d08</a></div>
		
<div>Fidelity is caprice, fraternity is tumult and marriage is the entropy of intentionality. Bergson <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:143-144)</span> distinguishes two kinds of disorder, one that is a lack of intentionality and another which violates utility. Here, we are evoking the second kind, that is, the randomness of creative acts. In that sense, marriage or any kind of human institution entailing a commitment is disorder as a mutual and creative evolution. All human commitments require continuous and spontaneous change from every member, towards their nearest. For, to separate is to stay the same, preserving the self as it is, but together we are changed and the love between us will be recreated, as if for the first time, with every new instant. This is what Marcel <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>)</span> meant by ‘creative fidelity’, where the commitment of love becomes faith – the love that belief entails – belief in God, the world, people, the other or anything whatever. This is a seeking to be changed rather than a conquest to apprehend, seize or extract knowledge from. The latter is how we lose our purview of the human condition and that is how we lose anthropology.</div>
