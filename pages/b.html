<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b01" class="position" href="m.html#b01" title="VR addresses anthropological questions.">b01</a></div>
			
<div>The goal of this essay is to frame VR (Virtual Reality) as an anthropological problem. This framing requires a broad look at the phenomenon, with a focus on its roots and potential in relation to the human. To participate in the experience of VR is to opt into a philosophical demonstration, which reinforces early ideas in Western Philosophy that are still directing and motivating the development of VR and other technologies today. It will become clear that these ideas cannot be fully extracted from the phenomenon of VR as a lived human experience. To consider VR in isolation, as a mere entertainment apparatus, is to occlude the narrative we draw from to give the experience meaning. Alternatively, to approach the history of ideas that have led to the development of VR, without taking into consideration the actual lived experience of using the technology, misses the medium’s potential as a plane of human expression. An anthropological approach considers the human, as problematic, first, making space for an investigation of VR as both agent and manifestation of historical process. VR is revealed to be an expression of an ambition that is not historically unique but that is being accomplished in unprecedented ways. That is, in this essay, we use VR to answer the question – What is the human? – and observe what this expression of humanity can teach us.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b02" class="position" href="m.html#b02" title="Ryan gives VR’s standard definition.">b02</a></div>

<div>In her book, <em>Narrative as Virtual Reality</em>, Ryan <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>)</span> describes VR as ‘an immersive, interactive experience generated by a computer’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ryan <a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:12)</span>. For Ryan, immersion and interaction are two overlapping and crucial components, central to the experience that is VR. Though Ryan <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:69-72)</span> will later go on to incorporate the ideas in Merleau-Ponty’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>)</span> <em>Phenomenology of Perception</em> into her description of VR, her initial definition is standard.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b03" class="position" href="m.html#b03" title="VR immersion is a matter of sense data.">b03</a></div>		

<div>Merleau-Ponty’s critique of Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> rejected the idea of a ‘sensation as pure impression’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Merleau-Ponty <a href="5.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:4)</span>, but VR entails the creation of sense data in the form of a pixel or a bladder in a haptic glove. Unlike Merleau-Ponty’s critique, these quantifiable characteristics are inescapably tied to the notion of VR as, computed immersion. VR is defined as a phenomenon that is in pursuit of a ceiling, an assumption that perception is only a matter of information in high enough quantities. It is a perspective described by Buber’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1987</a>)</span> I-It orientation towards the world, which is to scientifically view objects as the causers of experience. In this sense, VR becomes an act of substitution and capture.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b04" class="position" href="m.html#b04" title="VR emphasizes mind-body dualism.">b04</a></div>

<div>VR is often marketed as a ‘disembodiment’ or form of escapism and to whatever degree such is the case, it is also embodied and immanent. The experience of ‘transcendence’ is achieved through finite means. As far as we regard VR to consist of this gesture, it is a dismissal of Buber’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1958</a>)</span> famous I-Thou stance, which is to acknowledge that human life ‘does not consist merely of activities that have something for their object’. Though particulars vary, in VR the direction and focus are fixed on the subject in a way that maintains a mind-body dualism. This emphasis is consistent, though some are more explicit than others. Thus, Ryan <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>)</span>, as well as Kipman <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>)</span> and Moravec <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>)</span> which will be discussed below, demonstrate that to work with, participate in and even describe VR in its own terms, is to adopt ‘the point of view of the body-object… sensation seems to be a communication’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Marcel <a href="5.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:26)</span>. When VR is both finite (computed) and immersive (approaching the inexhaustible scope of lived human experience), we see that VR-the-technology is very specific to certain conditions of modernity.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b05" class="position" href="m.html#b05" title="Definitions of VR are symptoms of philosophies.">b05</a></div>

<div>We can identify the demonstration of particular values and beliefs about reality when people are defining what VR is. For example, when Heim <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1994" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (1994) The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality">1994</a>; <a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3-5)</span> ties up the various loose ends of his definition, it contains statements that are deliberately metaphysical (so he describes them, and such is the name of his book) and also deeper presumptions that make those statements possible. Heim <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3)</span> presents VR in the ‘weak’ and ‘strong sense’. The former is identified in the prevalence of VR in the language used to refer to technology more broadly. Anything from TVs, video games or a new car might be described as ‘virtual reality’ in the right context. Heim’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3)</span> ‘strong sense’ provides an example of metaphysical exposition within a definition of VR. It is a definition that has directed Heim’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>)</span> work as a philosopher since he presented it in his book, <em>The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality</em>, more than twenty years ago. Heim’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:7)</span> ‘three “I”s of virtual reality’ — ‘immersion, interactivity and information intensity’ — likely inspired Ryan’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:12)</span> definition, but while Ryan <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:20)</span> is ultimately willing to treat VR as ‘a metaphor for total art’, Heim does not deviate from VR-the-technology. According to Heim <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:7)</span>, VR in the ‘strong sense’ did not emerge until ‘computers became powerful enough to control several input/output devices that feed information in and out of the human body’.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b06" class="position" href="m.html#b06" title="Heim sees VR as a means of enlightenment.">b06</a></div>

<div>Heim <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 2017a" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017a) VR Third WAVE: Book One of Virtual Reality Metaphysics">2017a</a>)</span> describes VR as an ideal. This is demonstrated in his recent series of books under the title, <em>Virtual Reality Metaphysics</em>. He sees VR as ‘a tool for enlightenment’ and ‘a pathway to a heightened sense of reality’ that ‘touches spiritual and metaphysical depths’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Heim <a href="5.html#Heim 2017a" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017a) VR Third WAVE: Book One of Virtual Reality Metaphysics">2017a</a>:para.1)</span>. Heim’s recent books are a guide to help users get more out of their virtual reality experiences and draw on ‘Renaissance magic’, phenomenology, psychology and ancient Gnosticism:</div>
	<blockquote><span class="small">Through heightened awareness of the primal elements of experience, the cybernaut or VR traveler, like the Renaissance magus, aims for psychological balance by applying simple meditative techniques post-headset immersion.</span> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Heim <a href="5.html#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:7)</span></blockquote>
<div>This is how Heim describes it in a recent article in which he addresses the anxiety associated with ‘technological Platonism’ not far removed from Baudrillard <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>)</span>. The anxiety that comes out of the fear of the ‘virtual-as-fake’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Ryan <a href="5.html#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:27)</span> will (or in Baudrillard’s case, already <em>has</em>) ‘entrap users in a fascination with a perfect world… thus eclipsing the actual imperfect material world’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Heim <a href="5.html#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:162)</span>. But Heim sees VR experiences as a transcendental means of coming to terms with the immanent in a fuller sense. His notion of ‘bridging real and virtual’ still regards them as separate domains, which can be reconnected to prevent anxiety or disorientation by representing the four elements as touchstones in 3D virtual environments <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Heim <a href="5.html#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:177)</span>. For Heim, VR experiences are immersive and ‘realistic’ enough to result in a bodily disorientation and existential anxiety, but they can also apparently teach us things about actual reality, though not in a scientific way: ‘The procedure is magical (associational) rather than rational, symbolic rather than literal, phenomenological rather than objective, and ritualistic rather than technological’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Heim <a href="5.html#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:177)</span>. In this way, Heim provides an example of how VR is generating new concepts within the scientific means that make the technology possible in the first place. He sees transcendental value in the VR experience, though it can be contextualised as a reductive gesture based on the assumption that perception is quantifiable. Of course, we can review Heim’s sources and take his historical analyses of Western thought seriously. But his ideas also seem to be a reaction to the experience of VR itself. Heim’s work is an expression of the human phenomenon we are trying to understand.</div>

<blockquote class="small">We are standing at the threshold of the next revolution in computing. A revolution where computers empower us to expand our capabilities and transcend time, space, and devices.</blockquote>
<div>The ambition behind this statement is something to behold and it is possible to treat Kipman’s description of a ‘revolution of computing’ as a metaphysical statement: his language seems to assume that space and time are finite and can be ‘transcended’ by manipulating the subject through technology, and human perception is conflated with what has ontological value. Of course, Kipman, here, is not formally attempting a metaphysics, only a sales pitch; in this light, it would be inaccurate to regard his ‘space’ and ‘time’ as universal concepts. This contextualisation notwithstanding, even a ‘renegotiation’ in the most limited sense will have a dramatic impact on the way people think about the world.

It does not take a formal metaphysics to fulfil the kind of sweeping ontological shifts Kipman is describing here.

On one hand, we had the canonical fathers of Western philosophy like Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> and Kant <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> trying to build a metaphysics compatible with the overwhelming successes of the sciences, which resulted in an epistemological turn <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>)</span>. On the other hand, today and for quite some time now, we have what might be called the reverse. Through technologies like VR and artificial intelligence (fruits of the scientific method), we can identify an effort to validate and demonstrate the values central to epistemological projects of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, i.e. rationalism, objectivity and a particular conception of the mind. But this is not to be interpreted as an attempt to epistemologically re-establish what philosophy – which was once the ‘most basic’ and ‘foundational discipline’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Rorty <a href="5.html#Rorty 1979" target="_blank" title="Rorty R (1979) Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature">1979</a>:132)</span> – is now failing to achieve. That is, aspirations for VR are more than a compensation for or reaction against postmodern ideas threatening scientific methods.</div>

<div>VR does not only reflect a Cartesian desire to correctly represent an independent reality; it is no longer a matter of accurate representation but replication. While Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>:3)</span> has traced the connections between this latter conception of knowledge tied to epistemology and the ‘…notions about science and about the nature of human agency [connecting] with certain central moral and spiritual ideas of the modern age’, VR seems to demonstrate that these values run deeper still and in ways that have escaped the historical or genealogical approaches of Taylor and other authors who have attempted similar projects <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(for example, Blumenberg <a href="5.html#Blumenberg 1985" target="_blank" title="Blumenberg H (1985) The Legitimacy of the Modern Age">1985</a>, Foucault <a href="5.html#Foucault 1966" target="_blank" title="Foucault M (1966/2005) The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences">2005</a>, Habermas <a href="5.html#Habermas 1991" target="_blank" title="Habermas J (1991) The structural transformation of the public sphere: an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society">1991</a>)</span>. The experience of using VR provides its own type of response to these authors’ theses regarding the progress of modernity and its achievements, which precedes any historical narrative we might employ to problematize it.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b11" class="position" href="m.html#b11" title="Philosophical speculations are informed by VR.">b11</a></div>

<div>VR seems to invite philosophical speculation in the way it presents itself as a demonstration of both the future of humanity and the fundamental principles underlying reality. Much of this has to do with the way VR performs the approach of a limit that has implications for reality as a whole.

This is to reveal hidden characteristics that could not have been accessed any other way and amounts to a radical shift in perspective, a lack of submission to natural forces.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b14" class="position" href="m.html#b14" title="VR is seen as an answer to ontological questions.">b14</a></div>

<div>In this way, VR is regarded as something of an answer to certain ontological questions made imperative by the conditions of modern society. This was demonstrated at a virtual reality event I went to in Melbourne, early 2018. I sat in the audience listening to a panel of VR filmmakers as they answered questions about the challenges they face in the new medium — like managing the inherent level of autonomy that gives each user a different experience. The person hosting the event finished with some questions of her own along these same lines, but I found her last question to be very unexpected and completely irrelevant to the discussion they had been having up to that point. She asked the members of the panel if they thought we were approaching, at some point in the future, a VR experience that is indistinguishable from reality. Their speculative and unflinching responses seemed to generate more interest than the previous discussions regarding the process and technical challenges of creating a VR film itself. Socialising after the event led me to believe that discussions about the future of VR and what that might reveal about the nature of reality are what most people had come to the event for in the first place. The position of progress celebrated and demonstrated through technological innovation cannot escape what Blumenberg <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Blumenberg 1985" target="_blank" title="Blumenberg H (1985) The Legitimacy of the Modern Age">1985</a>)</span> described as the unanswered questions of the previous era, and it seems natural and exciting to apply our new experiences to the oldest of questions, especially when those experiences are as provocative and confounding as VR. Thus, VR inspires a type of metaphysical contemplation because it is itself a metaphysical statement or demonstration that is profoundly novel.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b15" class="position" href="m.html#b15" title="VR expresses old ideas in new contexts.">b15</a></div>

<div>It is possible to view VR as a re-enactment of the values tied to the methodologies descended from Descartes <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> but this historical construal does not resemble a ‘renegotiation’ like Kipman’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>)</span>, it only amounts to a philosophical demonstration that is an affirmation of the scientific method’s ability to capture reality to the utmost, to quantify it in a kind of reductive positivism. However, while it is reasonable to place VR at the end of a particular ‘master narrative’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>::291, 315)</span>, a science that ‘disenchants’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Weber <a href="5.html#Weber 1905" target="_blank" title="Weber M (1905/2001) The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">2001</a>)</span> and captures the world, this says nothing about how VR is influencing those same ideological and ontological premises the technology is an expression of. In Moravec’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>)</span> and Musk’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Musk 2017" target="_blank" title="Musk E (17 February 2018) ‘Are We In A Simulation? - Elon Musk’ [video]">2018</a>)</span> simulation arguments, Cartesianism still seems very present, VR is still an extension of the abounding successes of the physical sciences. To regard VR as a demonstration of technology’s ability to capture, by means of replication, every aspect of the human experience might even be called an extreme application of Descartes’s methodological scepticism and dualism. But these ideas are being expressed in new contexts, through different mediums and are finding novel conclusions, as we have already seen in Moravec’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>: para.1)</span> ‘physical fundamentalism’ and Heim’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>)</span> references to Buddhism and Gnosticism are another example. These give a preliminary picture of the different shades of ideas that have motivated VR as a broad phenomenon, and also how individuals are incorporating the experience of VR into their understanding of the world and themselves.</div>

<div>Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>; <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>)</span> has described the modern sense of self extensively by contextualising it within a broad historical narrative. In <em>Sources of the Self</em> <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>)</span>, he sets out to describe modern individualism and the values associated with it via the history of Western thought and in <em>A Secular Age</em>, Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>)</span> employs a similar method, this time to describe the ‘conditions of belief’ in modern secular pluralism. To convey the drastic changes that have contributed to our current understanding of ourselves and the world, Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:35)</span> contrasts the ‘buffered self’ we experience today to the more ‘porous’ understanding of the self our ancestors had. This ‘porousness’ can be identified in the fears people had of being possessed but extends to general explanations for emotional states as well. This is something that has been demonstrated in anthropology. <em>Divinity and Experience</em> paints ultra-human forces that have the potential to permeate every facet of a person’s physical and psychological state <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Lienhardt <a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>)</span>. Free divinities might enter a person at any time taking over their body or if a Dinka wish ill of another person, tying a knot around a tuft of grass might hinder them <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Lienhardt <a href="5.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:282)</span>. One of Lienhardt’s contemporaries at Oxford might question the connection between the individual and the grass. In this way, their understanding of self and agency is ‘buffered’. Lienhardt’s descriptions throw our own immunity or buffered state into relief. Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:37)</span> describes the ‘buffered self’ with the following example:</div>
<blockquote class="small">A modern is feeling depressed, melancholy. He is told: it’s just your body chemistry, you’re hungry, or there is a hormone malfunction, or whatever. Straightaway, he feels relieved. He can take a distance from this feeling, which is ipso facto declared not justiﬁed. Things don’t really have this meaning it just feels this way, which is the result of a causal action utterly unrelated to the meanings of things. This step of disengagement depends on our modern mind/body distinction, and the relegation of the physical to being ‘just’ a contingent cause of the psychic.</blockquote>
<div>This buffered state can be a source of encouragement (my life is not really that bad, I just have a chemical imbalance) or crippling accountability (I am not the victim of possession, there is something wrong with me). The former was the focus of Taylor’s example and ‘depends on our modern mind/body distinction’ but the latter describes the objectification of a subject; a person has become a problem to be fixed. Whatever ideals we strive for, as buffered selves, must either be achieved through a manipulation and dehumanisation of the subject-as-problem or through a manipulation of our own environment. This applies to political issues too. That is, we do not appeal to any ultra-human powers to accomplish social change. We might regard a group of people to be incorrect or victims of particular inequalities, and we can complicate the story as much as we like, moving the causes of whatever issue we have in mind further into the past creating a history of thought or genealogy of ideas. But all this really amounts to is a shift of that crippling accountability associated with the buffered self, further into the past, or further into our brains.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b17" class="position" href="m.html#b17" title="VR reflects a response to exclusive humanism.">b17</a></div>

<div>In this way, VR is a reaction to or expression of this ‘disenchanted’ state. I can explain whatever resistances I encounter in life through the lens of exclusive humanism and I can do so in a way that is empowering, but that empowerment depends on a separation of myself from my environment, body or brain – it entails a kind of dualism. VR is an example of Taylor’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>)</span> exclusive humanism completely following through with this idea, maintaining a hyper-individualism, dealing with the accountability of the buffered self through a form of extreme escapism – an escapism that uses scientific methodologies to manipulate the subject. It is the ultimate accommodation for a lack of ultra-human forces for our isolated and buffered individualist state.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b18" class="position" href="m.html#b18" title="VR creates a self-centered, individualist experience.">b18</a></div>

<div>VR is an extreme expression of modern individualism in many ways. One way of countering individualist ideologies, if you are inclined to do so, is to draw attention to what Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:36)</span> calls ‘webs of interlocution’. This is in the way my sense of self depends on my relations to particular interlocutors, not only in relation to language but even the meaning and value I derive from my individuality; it depends on the Other. The self needs a structure that is both social and moral to exist, and in this context, Descartes’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> cogito loses meaning. VR can be seen as a means of giving the isolated cogito structure. It is not ‘psychological adjustment’ but an external accommodation, a fulfilment of individualisation in a way that is not dependent on the Other. It is the ultimate affirmation of the modern sense of self Taylor is describing. If I pick up a rock on the beach, I can study it and contemplate the seemingly infinite number of contingencies through space and time that have contributed to the composition of that rock and my having chanced upon it. This thought has implications for my identity and prominence in the scheme of the universe. A program in VR can be created to simulate that experience, but in the digital world where it takes place, I am at the true centre. Even if rocks are generated by an algorithm randomly, all those rocks exist for me; my gaze summons them into existence. It is like a miniature idealism has been constructed within and by a scientific positivism.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b19" class="position" href="m.html#b19" title="VR asserts dominance over the universe.">b19</a></div>

<div>This draws attention to a strange dissonance between modern ideals and valued epistemologies.

My sense of self is threatened by the crushing weight of an indifferent universe. VR, however, reinforces the value of the self while also being a demonstration of how robust scientific methodologies are. Of course, VR is still a communicative act and still constitutes a ‘web of interlocution’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:36)</span>, but the gesture of VR is to occlude those traits in a way that reinforces individualism while also asserting a type of dominance over the universe. VR is an elaborate way of achieving both seemingly incompatible values and notwithstanding the cost.</div>

But VR often betrays this value, for as it strives to be a technology that enables the clearest expression of our wills, the means by which this is accomplished entails an objectification of the individual, through both capitalist consumer contexts and also through the way VR seeks to manipulate and control human perception.

<div>This has some implications for VR in the way it is strived for as a utopian ideal. Our society still holds to a particular kind of eschatology that is embedded in the institutions of modern science, though this is not essential to any scientific method based on observation and hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Scientific methods depend on an unknown and a lack of resolution and this is something Kant <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> reinforced in his metaphysics.

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b23" class="position" href="m.html#b23" title="VR embodies secular pluralism and ‘progress’.">b23</a></div>

<div>We can see these aspirations visibly being demonstrated in rhetoric pertaining to a virtual utopia, a future of humanity that has fully overcome all resistance pertinent to the human condition. Löwith <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Löwith 1957" target="_blank" title="Löwith K (1957) Meaning in history: the theological implications of the philosophy of history">1957</a>)</span> presented a Heideggerian-style historical analysis of the history of the philosophy of history, working his way backward from Burckhardt <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Burckhardt 1943" target="_blank" title="Burckhardt J (1943) Refections on history">1943</a>)</span> to the <em>Bible</em> to reveal the eschatological roots of Western philosophy’s conception of History. This can also be identified in Western projections of the future and VR emerges and finds value as a demonstration of that trajectory. Like many technologies, VR reinforces a narrative of progress. Beyond demonstrating a particular set of beliefs about reality, VR demonstrates the approach of an ideal that is based on the moral premises of Western culture. Though, as MacIntyre <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>)</span> has demonstrated, these premises are deeply flawed, they are ‘fragmented’ in a way that constitutes the peculiar conditions of secular pluralism.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b24" class="position" href="m.html#b24" title="VR provides an escape to an idealized human existence.">b24</a></div>

<div>Part of Taylor’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>)</span> thesis is that there is something fundamentally disorientating about secular pluralism, the unprecedented coexistence of irreconcilable worldviews. We can view VR as a technology that has emerged out of and in response to these conditions, it is the ultimate liberation of the individual physically, mentally and morally. Morally, not just in the way VR enables individuals to perform violent acts or virtual sex without consequence – these aspirations are present but not central to the culture of VR enthusiasts I am currently aware of – morally, in the way these deeply inform our conceptions of self. Hence, Taylor <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:4)</span> uses the term, ‘strong evaluations’ to convey a broader moral picture that extends beyond questions of right and wrong and into questions regarding what constitutes a good life, what is worthy of praise beyond aesthetics, ‘a moral reaction is an assent to, an affirmation of, a given ontology of the human’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Taylor <a href="5.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:5)</span>. When the question of morals is viewed more broadly in this way, it is easy to see how VR entails a very clear picture of these ‘strong evaluations’. They are thrown into relief because the whole point of VR is to provide an escape to an ideal that people have of human existence.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b25" class="position" href="m.html#b25" title="VR’s value lies in its unreality.">b25</a></div>	

<div>It must be acknowledged that most instances of VR have value because they are not real. If a shooting game felt too real, for example, the experience would lose value and the user would become terrified and experience the same kind of trauma as real war. But these examples might only demonstrate the dissonance present in our moral condition, an inconsistency in the things we are reaching for and in what positively reinforces our sense of self. VR seems to reveal inconsistencies in the way it is an elaborate accommodation for them.</div>

VR is employed as a means of defining virtual worlds and then left aside, it is what distracts us from the ‘alternative realities’ that need investigation — ‘a ﬂight simulator run from a single computer not connected to the internet… is not a virtual world, because it disappears when the computer is turned off’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span>. Compared to virtual worlds, the notion of VR has no essential social continuity. In this way, VR is less interesting to the social scientist or anthropologist and would best be left to the phenomenologist or psychologist concerned with sensory experience. But the gestures implicit in the idea of VR — its social, political and ontological implications which we have been exploring above — are lost when it is placed against ‘virtual worlds’ as an object of study. While no one is suggesting that these terms are mutually exclusive, VR is stepped over, dismissed as a potential trait of some virtual worlds but often, in the case of single-player games, is a term for describing experiences that are less ‘real’. The gesture of VR is simulation and not sociality. The latter not only defines virtual worlds but earns them the status of ‘alternative realities’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Boellstorff <a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span>. The somewhat oxymoronic term ‘virtual reality’, implies the complete opposite of real, something that we know is not real yet feels otherwise to an extent. Boellstorff is not the only scholar who has been preoccupied with the task of validating the reality of ‘virtual worlds’; Malpas <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Malpas 2009" target="_blank" title="Malpas J (2009) ‘On the Non-Autonomy of the Virtual’">2009</a>)</span> has argued that they are embedded extensions of everyday reality; at her weekly pizza parties, Turkle <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Turkle 2011" target="_blank" title="Turkle S (2011) Alone together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other">2011</a>:xi)</span> saw ‘the erosion of boundaries between the real and virtual’ in the way people experience their online identities; even the very notion of an ‘ethnography for the internet’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Hine <a href="5.html#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>, Garcia et al. <a href="5.html#Garcia 2009" target="_blank" title="Garcia AC, Standlee AI, Bechkoff J and Cui Y 2009, ‘Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication’">2009</a>)</span> presumes the reality of the context and its presence in the ‘real’ <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(also see, Miller <a href="5.html#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>:2)</span>. VR, however, does not emerge for its own sake.</div>

<div>One problem with more direct affirmations of the reality of virtual worlds, like Boellstorff’s <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(<a href="5.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>)</span>, is the vagueness attached to the term ‘real’ itself – though if this can be convincingly conveyed, it does elevate the importance and perceived ramifications of a project. The value of VR is closely tied to the fact that it is not real in a particular physical sense but nevertheless feels otherwise. It should go without saying that it is all a matter of context — I did really kill that dragon… in Skyrim VR <span class="reference" aria-hidden="true">(Howard <a href="5.html#Howard 2017" target="_blank" title="Howard T (director) (2017) Elder scrolls v: Skyrim VR [videogame]">2017</a>)</span>. The values and beliefs that are tied up in the act of seeking and creating something that fulfils these conditions, that is a simulation that continues to approach something indistinguishable from reality, have not received enough attention. One evidence of this is the lack of anthropological literature we had to engage with above. But we need to expand our understanding of what encompasses the phenomenon; the act itself of defining VR is often an expression of the very conditions we are seeking to engage with. In this way, reviewing how VR is generally defined, as I have done here, does more than locate our point of inquiry.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b28" class="position" href="m.html#b28" title="VR is a creative response for anthropology.">b28</a></div>	

<div>In contrast to definitions of VR that have been explored throughout this essay, an anthropology of VR should not be concerned with the origins of individualism as a historical question. Of course, such understandings are relevant to VR as a topic – what it is, what is motivating its development, etc. – as we have explored, but we should not let this distract us from the human phenomenon we are ultimately trying to understand. An effort must be made to accommodate for VR’s own creative responses to these questions. Anthropology is in a unique position to do this, not only because of the methodological traditions it has at its disposal, such as participant observation, but because VR will not be engaged with for its own sake, but for the sake of enabling new understandings of the human. This focus is what can pull disparate approaches, like the experience of using VR versus the history of ideas it emerged from, together – VR ceases to be an end in itself and becomes a means of understanding the human, something to think about the human with.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b29" class="position" href="m.html#b29" title="Anthropology should take VR seriously.">b29</a></div>

<div>This essay has been concerned with framing VR as an anthropological issue, something anthropologists ought to take seriously and think the anthropological question with. It should be obvious that the core method of anthropological engagements, namely ethnography, is almost entirely absent from my investigation. The only real reason a can give for this is a lack of sufficient space to do that topic justice and address such a complex issue. But I do have space to say that I have at least, I believe, addressed things in the correct order. We must come to terms with VR first, and its potential framing as an anthropological question before describing the method by which we might explore it. If we pose the question correctly enough, the way forward for further research should become obvious anyway. All I will say here is that traditional ethnographies hardly give VR space to move as what it is, and that if anything, we should treat VR as a kind of anthropology in and of itself. But here I am going beyond the intended scope of the present essay, which was to frame and prove VR as an anthropological problem.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" align="right"><a id="b30" class="position" href="m.html#b30" title="Traditional ethnography ignores VR’s impact.">b30</a></div>

<div>If anthropology is defined by that which it seeks to understand, namely the human, rather than some methodological tradition like ethnographic fieldwork – and a very specific understanding of what ethnography entails – there might be no more pressing issue to the discipline than the current technological innovations seeking to redefine the human and ‘its contracts with reality’. Such innovations are being ignored, however, due to their incompatibility with traditional ethnographic ‘fieldwork’. This essay has been an attempt at describing one of those ambitions that are redefining human experience, taking it incredibly seriously as an anthropological problem.</div>
