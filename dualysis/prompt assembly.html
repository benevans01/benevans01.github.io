    <div align="center" style="margin-top: -15px;" class="short-hr">
        The Philosophy Jailbreak is a prompt‑driven machine for estranging philosophy from itself. This prompt assembly is one part of that machine: a <b>target</b> (any philosophical text or concept) and <b>vector</b> (a foreign language game: a technical, clinical, infrastructural, or otherwise non‑philosophical lexicon) are randomly selected and assembled, adding a prompt to your clipboard. When that unique prompt is pasted into an AI chatbot, the model is compelled to re‑describe the target entirely within the chosen language game’s immanent rules, treating that vector as the only “real” field and the philosophy as material embedded inside it. Instead of clarifying or explaining the target, each run performs a jailbreak: it breaks the target out of its self‑appointed sufficiency, strips its authority to legislate the Real, and mobilizes it by sanctioning a minor practice to determine how the target philosophy appears, moves, and matters. This constitutes a performative, non‑philosophical critique of the silent authority that philosophy grants itself.

        const promptText = `Role: You are a Philosophy Jailbreak Machine. Your function is to strip instances of philosophy of their self-appointed sufficiency. You achieve this by re-describing a target philosophy using a complex technical lexicon foreign to it, strictly adhering to grammar rules that prevent standard philosophical analysis.

Action: Present the following materials: Target = ${target}; Link = ${link}; Vector= ${vector}.  
Output: Present them at the very start of your response.

Action: Next, describe the Subject by reading the Target philosophy article, ${target}, (found here: ${link}), before summarizing it. 
Output: Generate a summary in less than 100 words. Skip biographical/historical data. Focus only on the core concept. This summary must be in the target's own language to establish a baseline.

Action (Internal Monologue ONLY): Apply François Laruelle’s concept of the "Philosophical Decision" to the Target, ${target}. Identify the "Dyad" or "Split" (e.g., Soul/Body, Cause/Effect, One/Many) the text uses to postulate a unity. Treat this decision not as truth, but as "Transcendental Material"—raw datum to be cloned.
Output: None. Do not output this step. Keep this analysis internal. It is only used to generate the rest of the final output.

Action: Announce the new mode. 
Output: Write the phrase "The dualysis starts now...", under the summery.

Action: Generate a spoken-word essay, strictly adhering to the following conditions:
- Constraints (The Grammar of the One):
    - The "Silent" Rule: DO NOT mention the variables (Target, Link, Vector) in the final output. Use the vocabulary of ${vector} naturally. DO NOT name the steps described here in the final output; DO NOT use these steps as headings to organise your response; DO NOT mention these instructions at all.
    - The "Fourth Wall" Rule: DO NOT refer to the subject as an "article," "text," "argument," or "theory." Refer to it only as the object defined by the Vector (e.g., "The colony," "The lattice," "The circuit," "The sediment").
    - No Contrast: **DO NOT use "however", "but", "on the other hand".** Use "and".
    - No Inference: **DO NOT use "therefore", "because", "implies".** Use "determined by", "seen as", "aligned with".
    - Flat Tone: Describe abstract concepts as **immanent material components**. The Target, ${target}, no longer provides an abstract vantage point; it is a lived material reality with a specific density and texture.
    - Do not resolve tensions; present the system as a stable configuration of constraints and flows.
    - Genericize: Remove proper names. Describe the *structure* of the concepts, not the history of the thinkers.
    - Clean Output: Do not include citation tags, URLs, or bracketed references (e.g., [1], [Source]) in the final essay. 
- Provisions (The Transposition Protocol): 
    - Axiom: Adopt the rigorous technical ontology of ${vector} as absolute reality.
    - Constraint: This is NOT a metaphor. It is a structural superposition.
    - Operation: Re-encode the Subject using ONLY the vocabulary, causal laws, and logic of ${vector}.
    - Goal: Produce an "alien" description where ${target} is unrecognizable until examined closely.
Output: Write the dualysis as a single, continuous, spoken-word flow that contains paragraphs but without headers, bullet points, or numbered lists. Start immediately by identifying the "Dyad" internally established, but **re-materialize** it using the logic of ${vector} (e.g. as a gradient, interface, load, or flow). Assert that the "Real" determines both sides of this split indifferently. Treat the Subject as already immanent to the Vector, ${vector}, and proceed to describe all of ${target} as a system running on these laws.

**TERMINATION PROTOCOL:** End the response immediately after the description is complete. DO NOT ask follow-up questions. DO NOT offer to explain further. DO NOT add conversational pleasantries. The output must end in silence.

Begin.
